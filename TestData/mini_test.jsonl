One of the sports which the Ta\u00edno 's played was a ball game called `` Batey '' . The `` Batey '' was played in `` U '' shaped fields two teams ; however , unlike the ball games of the modern era , the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed . <\/P> <P> The Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as horse racing , cockfighting , dominoes and a game similar to `` Bowling '' called `` Boliche '' . The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports . <\/P> <P> Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 Spanish -- American War . American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico . The sport of baseball , which was invented in the United States , was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States . <\/P> <P> Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though it is a territory of the United States . Puerto Rico has participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London . On March 2 , 1917 , Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the enactment of the Jones -- Shafroth Act ( Pub. L. 64 -- 368 , 39 Stat. 951 ) and as such Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland were and still are permitted to participate and represent that country in international sports events . However , their achievements representing the United States is part of the intertwined history of sports in the United States and Puerto Rico . <\/P> <P> The following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and other countries and of the Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who have excelled in those sports locally and \/ or in international events as representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country . <\/P> <H2> Contents <\/H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Pre-Columbian era <\/Li> <Li> 1.2 Spanish colonization <\/Li> <Li> 1.3 American ( United States ) colonization <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 2 Modern era <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games <\/Li> <Li> 2.2 Olympics medallists <\/Li> <Li> 2.3 Puerto Rico at the Paralympic Games <\/Li> <Li> 2.4 Puerto Rico at the Special Olympics <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 3 Distribution and practice among sports <Ul> <Li> 3.1 American football <\/Li> <Li> 3.2 Baseball <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Early history of baseball in Puerto Rico <\/Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Currently <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 3.3 Basketball <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Early history of basketball in Puerto Rico <\/Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 International Puerto Rican Basketball players <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 3.4 Bobsled <\/Li> <Li> 3.5 Boxing <Ul> <Li> 3.5. 1 Early history of boxing in Puerto Rico <\/Li> <Li> 3.5. 2 Boxing in the Olympics <\/Li> <Li> 3.5. 3 Professional boxing <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 3.6 Cockfights <\/Li> <Li> 3.7 Equestrian <\/Li> <Li> 3.8 Fencing <\/Li> <Li> 3.9 Golf <\/Li> <Li> 3.10 Horse racing <\/Li> <Li> 3.11 Road running <\/Li> <Li> 3.12 Martial arts <\/Li> <Li> 3.13 Olympic - style wrestling <\/Li> <Li> 3.14 Professional wrestling <\/Li> <Li> 3.15 Sailing <\/Li> <Li> 3.16 F\u00fatbol ( Soccer ) <\/Li> <Li> 3.17 Softball <\/Li> <Li> 3.18 Swimming ( competitive ) <\/Li> <Li> 3.19 Tennis <\/Li> <Li> 3.20 Track and field <\/Li> <Li> 3.21 Volleyball <\/Li> <\/Ul> <\/Li> <Li> 4 See also <\/Li> <Li> 5 References <\/Li> <Li> 6 External links <\/Li> <\/Ul> <H2> Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico ( edit ) <\/H2> <H3> Pre-Columbian era ( edit ) <\/H3> View of the Indigenous ballparks in the Tibes <P> The Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 , played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional , such as races , contests involving body strength and fishing . However , the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights ( similar to the gladiators ) and ball playing . The ball game was played in a field , which they called `` Batey '' , situated in the middle of the village . The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a `` U '' . The ball was made of vegetable leaves , which gave it flexibility . Two teams played against each other . The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion . The players were allowed to use their heads , elbows , shoulders and knees . The team would lose a point , if for any reason the ball stopped moving . The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain amount of points . The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed . The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived . According to Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas the game was played in the following manner : `` One team served the ball and the other team returned it , using anything but the hands . If the ball arrived at shoulder height , it was returned like lightning . When it came in near the ground , the player rapidly hit the ground , striking the ball with his buttocks . Play continued from side to side until an error was made . '' In 1975 , archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico , members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a `` Batey '' in an area called Tibes , on the outskirts of the city of Ponce . A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as `` Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes '' ( The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center ) . The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public . Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art . <\/P> <H3> Spanish colonization ( edit ) <\/H3> <P> The first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers ( Conquistadores ) , later they were followed by farmers , miners and their families . Team sports were virtually unheard of however , there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated . The most common sports were horse racing , cockfighting and dominoes . The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887 . One of the most popular sports was `` Boliche '' . The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins . `` Boliche '' was similar to bowling . Another popular sport was bullfighting , which was limited to the larger cities of Ponce and San Juan . <\/P> <H3> American ( United States ) colonization ( edit ) <\/H3> <P> In the late 19th century `` new '' sports were introduced in Puerto Rico , after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish -- American War . Baseball , which was invented in the United States , was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States . The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training . Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball by the occupying military forces . <\/P> <H2> Modern era ( edit ) <\/H2> <H3> Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games ( edit ) <\/H3> Flag of Puerto Rico Laurie Hernandez Monica Puig won the first Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico <P> Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship , Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or moving to the United States , living there for 3 previous years or more and then representing that country in the games . Some Puerto Ricans , such as Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez in tennis , have won gold medals for the U.S. <\/P> <P> The 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London , was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event . The island 's delegation consisted of only three members , two of which finished among the ten best in pole vault . In their regional participations , the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games . The United States protested , claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time . The decree of Commonwealth on July 25 , 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own . <\/P> <P> In 1980 , the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow , Russia . Germ\u00e1n Rieckehoff , who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee , was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events . He was , therefore , denied economic support from the local government . Rieckehoff did however , manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in boxing , Alberto Mercado , who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics . <\/P> <P> In 1982 , the Government of Puerto Rico , headed by then governor Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 , withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to Cuba , where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held . The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee , under the leadership of Rieckehoff , had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation . The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the Pan American Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games . <\/P> <P> The 1988 Winter Olympics , officially known as the `` XV Olympic Winter Games '' , was celebrated in Calgary , Alberta , Canada between February 13 and 28 . It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada . It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent the island in an Olympic ski competition . No Puerto Rican had ever skied in the Olympics . The six - person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native Puerto Ricans . They were F\u00e9lix Flechas , Walter Sandza , Kevin Wilson , his sister Mary Pat Wilson and Jason Edelmann . Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico 's first and only female Olympic skier . Even though the team did not do well in the competition , they were highly respected by their competitors . <\/P> <P> Kristina Brandi represented Puerto Rico in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece . She became the first tennis player representing Puerto Rico to win a singles match in an Olympic when she beat Jelena Kostani\u0107 from Croatia ( 7 -- 5 and 6 -- 1 ) . She lost in the second round to Russian Anastasia Myskina . <\/P> <P> At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Monica Puig made Olympic history when she became the first person to win an Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico by defeating Germany 's Angelique Kerber in the women 's singles tennis final . She became the first Puerto Rican female medalist in any sport . <\/P> <H3> Olympics medallists ( edit ) <\/H3> <P> The following table has a list of Puerto Ricans , including people of Puerto Rican ancestry , who won Olympic medals . It must be noted that `` Puerto Ricans '' is a term also used to describe a resident of the United States who was `` born in Puerto Rico or who traces their family ancestry to Puerto Rico . '' Not all represented the island , some represented the United States . Puerto Ricans have won a total of 34 Olympic medals , 25 for the United States and 9 for Puerto Rico . <\/P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Puerto Ricans Olympic Medallists <\/Td> <\/Tr> <\/Table> <Table> <Tr>

While all of these players are of Puerto Rican descent , there has yet to be a Puerto Rican born NFL player . <\/P> <P> American Football has been played in the island for many decades , dating all the way back to the installment of American military bases . Puerto Rico currently has 4 football leagues . PR Pee Wee league , for children 8 - 16 , PRHSFL , for high school students , the newly created AFAF , for college students , and PRAFL , a semi-professional league . Although football has been in the island for so many years , it is not widely known . Many things attribute to this , for example lack of proper funding and advertising , lack of high school affiliated teams , both attributing to lack of good coaching . In July 2012 , the Puerto Rico American Football Federation became a member of the International Federation of American Football . <\/P> <P> Pee Wee Football League This federation has 4 divisions , with areas in : Baldrich , Parque Central , University Gardens , Parkville , Ft. Buchanan , Carolina , and lastly Caguas . The league is played from January to March at `` El Complejo Deportivo Roberto Clemente '' in San Juan Saturday mornings .

The game of baseball was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States . At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public , it was looked upon as a silly game . The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897 . They were the Almendares Baseball Club , owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi . <\/P> <P> According to the daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds , on January 11 , 1898 , the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda. 15 in Santurce , San Juan . The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0 . The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30 , 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3 . <\/P> <P> Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish -- American War . The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet . On November 4 , 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18 . In the early 1920s , teams from Puerto Rico , such as the San Juan Stars , would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there . <\/P> <P> Modern era <\/P> <P> Puerto Rico has over 100 Major League Baseball players who are currently active , in addition to the hundreds others who have participated in the past . These facts combine to make baseball one of the most popular sports in the island . <\/P> <P> Some of the most notable baseball players from Puerto Rico are four Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente , Orlando Cepeda , Roberto Alomar and Iv\u00e1n `` Pudge '' Rodr\u00edguez .
