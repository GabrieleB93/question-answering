Painting of James Weddell's second expedition , depicting the brig Jane and the cutter Beaufoy . <p>The history of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent , known as Terra Australis , believed to exist in the far south of the globe . The term Antarctic , referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle , was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD . </p><p>The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita ( \"Unknown Southern Land\" ) , if it existed , was a continent in its own right . In 1773 James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time but although they discovered nearby islands , they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself . It is believed he was as close as 240\u00a0km ( 150\u00a0mi ) from the mainland . </p><p>On 27 January 1820 , a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev discovered an ice shelf at Princess Martha Coast that later became known as the Fimbul Ice Shelf . Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see and officially discover the land of the continent of Antarctica . Three days later , on 30 January 1820 , a British expedition captained by Irishman Edward Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula , and ten months later an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer sighted Antarctica on 17 November 1820 . The first landing was probably just over a year later when American Captain John Davis , a sealer , set foot on the ice . </p><p>Several expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century , during the \"Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration\" . Many resulted in injury and death . Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally reached the Pole on 13 December 1911 , following a dramatic race with the Briton Robert Falcon Scott . </p> <h2>Contents</h2> <ul> <li>1 Early exploration <ul> <li>1 . 1 The search for Terra Australis Incognita</li> <li>1 . 2 South of the Antarctic Convergence</li> <li>1 . 3 The Antarctic Circle</li> <li>1 . 4 First sighting</li> <li>1 . 5 Early exploration</li> </ul> </li> <li>2 Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration <ul> <li>2 . 1 Origins</li> <li>2 . 2 Early British expeditions</li> <li>2 . 3 Expeditions from other countries</li> <li>2 . 4 Race to the Pole</li> <li>2 . 5 Further expeditions</li> </ul> </li> <li>3 Further exploration <ul> <li>3 . 1 By air</li> <li>3 . 2 Overland crossing</li> </ul> </li> <li>4 Political history <ul> <li>4 . 1 British claims</li> <li>4 . 2 Other European claims</li> <li>4 . 3 South American involvement</li> <li>4 . 4 Post war developments</li> <li>4 . 5 Towards an international treaty</li> </ul> </li> <li>5 Recent history</li> <li>6 Women in Antarctica</li> <li>7 See also</li> <li>8 References</li> <li>9 Further reading</li> <li>10 External links</li> </ul> <h2>Early exploration[edit]</h2> <h3>The search for Terra Australis Incognita[edit]</h3> Main article : Terra Australis In 1570 a map by Ortelius showed the imagined link between the proposed continent of Antarctica and South America . Note also the proposed landmasses surrounding the North Pole . <p>Aristotle speculated , \"Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole . . . \" . [1] </p><p>It was not until Prince Henry the Navigator began in 1418 to encourage the penetration of the torrid zone in the effort to reach India by circumnavigating Africa that European exploration of the southern hemisphere began . [2] In 1473 Portuguese navigator Lopes Gon\u00e7alves proved that the equator could be crossed , and cartographers and sailors began to assume the existence of another , temperate continent to the south of the known world . </p><p>The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold , and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist . [2] </p><p>Ferdinand Magellan , who passed through the Straits of Magellan in 1520 , assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land , and it appeared as such on a map by Ortelius : Terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita ( \"Southern land recently discovered but not yet fully known\" ) . [3] </p> Map from 1771 , showing \"Terres Australes\" label without any charted landmass . <p>European geographers connected the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes , and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic , south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita ( \"Unknown Southern Land\" ) , a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics . The search for this great south land or Third World was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries . [2] In 1599 , according to the account of Jacob le Maire , the Dutch Dirck Gerritsz Pomp observed mountainous land at latitude ( 64\u00b0 ) . If so , these were the South Shetland Islands , and possibly the first European sighting of Antarctica ( or offshore-lying islands belonging to it ) . Other accounts , however , do not note this observation , casting doubt on their accuracy . It has been argued that the Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla claimed to have sighted \"snow-covered mountains\" beyond the 64\u00b0 S in 1603 , but this claim is not generally recognized . </p><p>Quir\u00f3s in 1606 took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo ( the New Hebrides ) and those he would discover \"even to the Pole\" . [2] </p><p>Francis Drake like Spanish explorers before him had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego . Indeed , when Schouten and Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615 , they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land . [2] </p><p>Finally , in 1642 Tasman showed that even New Holland ( Australia ) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent . Voyagers round the Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas ; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle , or knew it , if they did . [2] </p><p>The Dutch expedition to Valdivia of 1643 intended to round Cape Horn sailing through Le Maire Strait but strong winds made it instead drift south and east . [4] Northerly winds pushed the expedition as far south as 61\u00b059 S where icebergs were abundant before a southerly wind that begun on April 7 allowed the fleet to advance west . [4] The small fleet led by Hendrik Brouwer managed to enter the Pacific Ocean sailing south of Isla de los Estados disproving earlier beliefs that it was part of Terra Australis . [4][5][6] </p> <h3>South of the Antarctic Convergence[edit]</h3> <p>The visit to South Georgia by the English merchant Anthony de la Roch\u00e9 in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence . [7][8] Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict \u2018Roch\u00e9 Island\u2019 , honouring the discoverer . </p><p>James Cook was aware of la Roch\u00e9's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775 . [9] </p><p>Edmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52\u00b0\u00a0S in January 1700 , but that latitude ( he reached 140\u00a0mi off the north coast of South Georgia ) was his farthest south . A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \"South Land\" \u2013 described by a half legendary \"sieur de Gonneyville\" \u2013 resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 54\u00b010\u2032\u00a0S , and in the navigation of 48\u00b0 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55\u00b0\u00a0S in 1739 . [2] </p><p>In 1771 , Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \"a very large continent . \" He lighted upon a land in 50\u00b0\u00a0S which he called South France , and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent . He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land , and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation , but which was ultimately named after him . [2] </p> <h3>The Antarctic Circle[edit]</h3> Further information : Second voyage of James Cook James Cook's 1777 south-up map of South Georgia . <p>The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple , the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769 . The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook . Sailing in 1772 with the Resolution , a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and the Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux , Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island , then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58\u00b0\u00a0S , and then 30\u00b0 eastward for the most part south of 60\u00b0\u00a0S , a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel . On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67\u00b0 15' S by 39\u00b0 35' E , where their course was stopped by ice . [2] </p><p>Cook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands , of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town , but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen , Cook reached the assigned latitude 10\u00b0 too far east and did not see it . He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61\u00b0 52\u2032 S by 95\u00b0\u00a0E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60\u00b0\u00a0S to 147\u00b0\u00a0E . On 16 March , the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific . In November 1773 , Cook left New Zealand , having parted company with the Adventure , and reached 60\u00b0\u00a0S by 177\u00b0\u00a0W , whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed . The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days , being compelled after reaching 67\u00b0 31\u2032 S to stand north again in 135\u00b0\u00a0W . [2] </p><p>A long detour to 47\u00b0 50\u2032 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego . Turning south again , Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109\u00b0 30\u2032 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71\u00b0 10\u2032 S by 106\u00b0 54\u2032 W . This point , reached on 30 January 1774 , was the farthest south attained in the 18th century . With a great detour to the east , almost to the coast of South America , the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment . In November 1774 , Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53\u00b0 and 57\u00b0\u00a0S to Tierra del Fuego ; then , passing Cape Horn on 29 December , he rediscovered Roch\u00e9 Island renaming it Isle of Georgia , and discovered the South Sandwich Islands ( named Sandwich Land by him ) , the only ice-clad land he had seen , before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 . He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent . Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel , and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and of no economic value .

A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago , landed on King George Island , and claimed the new territories for Britain . </p><p>The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica , on 27 January 1820 , is attributed to the Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev , discovering an ice shelf at Princess Martha Coast that later became known as the Fimbul Ice Shelf . Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see and officially discover the land of the continent of Antarctica . </p><p>It is certain that the expedition , led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny , reached on 28 January 1820 a point within 32\u00a0km ( 20\u00a0mi ) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69\u00b021\u203228\u2033S 2\u00b014\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff69 . 35778\u00b0S 2 . 24722\u00b0W\ufeff / -69 . 35778 ; -2 . 24722[10] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf . On 30 January 1820 , Edward Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula , the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland . Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island , the first islands to be discovered south of the circle . </p> <h3>Early exploration[edit]</h3> See also : List of Antarctic expeditions <p>The first landing on the Antarctic mainland is thought to have been made by the American Captain John Davis , a sealer , who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821 , [11] though this is not accepted by all historians . [12] </p><p>In November 1820 , Nathaniel Palmer , an American sealer looking for seal breeding grounds , using maps made by the Loper whaling family , sighted what is now known as the Antarctic Peninsula , located between 55 and 80 degrees west . In 1823 , James Weddell , a British sealer , sailed into what is now known as the Weddell Sea . Until the twentieth century , most expeditions were for commercial purpose , to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting . A piece of wood , from the South Shetland Islands , was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica , obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829\u201331 , commanded by Captain Benjamin Pendleton . [13][14][15] </p><p>Charles Wilkes , as commander of a United States Navy expedition in 1840 , [16] discovered what is now known as Wilkes Land , a section of the continent around 120 degrees East . </p><p>After the North Magnetic Pole was located in 1831 , explorers and scientists began looking for the South Magnetic Pole . One of the explorers , James Clark Ross , a British naval officer , identified its approximate location , but was unable to reach it on his 4 year-expedition from 1839 to 1843 . Commanding the British ships Erebus and Terror , he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the Ross Ice Shelf , a massive floating ice shelf over 100 feet ( 30\u00a0m ) high . His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships : Mount Erebus , the most active volcano on Antarctica , and Mount Terror . [16] </p> Map of exploration routes , 1911 . <p>The first documented landing on the mainland of East Antarctica was at Victoria Land by the American sealer Mercator Cooper on 26 January 1853 . [17] </p><p>These explorers , despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration , were unable to penetrate the interior of the continent and , rather , formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica . Following the expedition South by the ships Erebus and Terror under James Clark Ross ( January , 1841 ) , he suggested that there were no scientific discoveries , or 'problems' , worth exploration in the far South . [18] What followed is what historian H . R . Mill called 'the age of averted interest'[18] and in the following twenty years after Ross' return , there was a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration . [18] </p> <h2>Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration[edit]</h2> <p>The Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration began at the end of the 19th century and closed with Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1917 . [19] </p><p>During this period the Antarctic continent became the focus of an international effort that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration and in which 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from ten countries . [20] </p> <h3>Origins[edit]</h3> Dr . John Murray was the driving force behind the renewal of interest in Antarctic exploration at the beginning of the 20th century . <p>The initial impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given by Dr . John Murray entitled \"The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration\" , given to the Royal Geographical Society in London , 27 November 1893 . [21] Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to \"resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south\" . [22] Furthermore , the Royal Geographical Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this , in 1887 , which successfully encouraged many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and laid the groundwork for the lecture given by Murray . [23] </p><p>The Norwegian ship Antarctic was put ashore at Cape Adare , on 24 January 1895 . [24] </p><p>In August 1895 the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration \"in whatever ways seem to them most effective\" . [25] Such work would \"bring additions to almost every branch of science\" . [25] The Congress had been addressed by the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink , who had just returned from a whaling expedition during which he had become one of the first to set foot on the Antarctic mainland . [2] During his address , Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition , to be based at Cape Adare . [26][27] </p> Adrien de Gerlache , leader of the Belgian expedition . <p>The Heroic Age was inaugurated by an expedition launched by the Belgian Geographical Society in 1897 ; Borchgrevink followed a year later with a privately sponsored British expedition . [28] ( Some histories consider the Discovery expedition , which departed in 1901 , as the first proper expedition of the Heroic Age . [29] ) </p><p>The Belgian Antarctic Expedition was led by Belgian Adrian de Gerlache . In 1898 , they became the first men to spend winter on Antarctica , when their ship Belgica became trapped in the ice . They became stuck on 28 February 1898 , and only managed to get out of the ice on 14 March 1899 . </p><p>During their forced stay , several men lost their sanity , not only because of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship , but also because of the language problems between the different nationalities . This was the first expedition to overwinter within the Antarctic Circle , [30][31] and they visited the South Shetland Islands . [32] </p> <h3>Early British expeditions[edit]</h3> RRS Discovery carried an expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott in 1901 . <p>The Southern Cross Expedition began in 1898 and lasted for two years . This was the first expedition to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland ( Cape Adare ) and was the first to make use of dogs and sledges . It made the first ascent of The Great Ice Barrier , ( The Great Ice Barrier later became formally known as the Ross Ice Shelf ) . The expedition set a Farthest South record at 78\u00b030'S . It also calculated the location of the South Magnetic Pole . [33][34] </p><p>The Discovery Expedition was then launched , from 1901\u201304 and was led by Robert Falcon Scott . It made the first ascent of the Western Mountains in Victoria Land , and discovered the polar plateau . Its southern journey set a new Farthest South record , 82\u00b017'S . Many other geographical features were discovered , mapped and named . This was the first of several expeditions based in McMurdo Sound . [35][36][37] </p> Jameson Adams , Frank Wild and Eric Marshall ( left to right ) of the Nimrod Expedition plant the Union flag at their southernmost position . <p>A year later , the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition was launched , headed by William Speirs Bruce . 'Ormond House' was established as a meteorological observatory on Laurie Island in the South Orkneys and was the first permanent base in Antarctica . The Weddell Sea was penetrated to 74\u00b001'S , and the coastline of Coats Land was discovered , defining the sea's eastern limits . [38][39][40] </p><p>Ernest Shackleton , who had been a member of Scott's expedition , organized and led the Nimrod Expedition from 1907 to 1909 . The expedition's primary objective was of reaching the South Pole . Based in McMurdo Sound , the expedition pioneered the Beardmore Glacier route to the South Pole , and the ( limited ) use of motorised transport . Its southern march reached 88\u00b023'S , a new Farthest South record 97 geographical miles from the Pole before having to turn back . During the expedition , Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau . Parties led by T . W . Edgeworth David also became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole . [41][42][43] </p> <h3>Expeditions from other countries[edit]</h3> Erich von Drygalski led the First German Antarctic Expedition in 1901 . <p>The First German Antarctic Expedition was sent to investigate eastern Antarctica in 1901 . It discovered the coast of Kaiser Wilhelm II Land , and Mount Gauss . The expedition's ship became trapped in ice , however , which prevented more extensive exploration . [44][45][46] </p><p>The Swedish Antarctic Expedition , operating at the same time worked in the east coastal area of Graham Land , and was marooned on Snow Hill Island and Paulet Island in the Weddell Sea , after the sinking of its expedition ship . It was rescued by the Argentinian naval vessel Uruguay . [47][48][49] </p><p>The French organized their first expedition in 1903 under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Charcot . Originally intended as a relief expedition for the stranded Nordenski\u00f6ld party , the main work of this expedition was the mapping and charting of islands and the western coasts of Graham Land , on the Antarctic peninsula . A section of the coast was explored , and named Loubet Land after the President of France . [50][51][52] </p><p>A follow up trip was organized from 1908\u20131910 which continued the earlier work of the French expedition with a general exploration of the Bellingshausen Sea , and the discovery of islands and other features , including Marguerite Bay , Charcot Island , Renaud Island , Mikkelsen Bay , Rothschild Island . [53] </p> <h3>Race to the Pole[edit]</h3> Main articles : Terra Nova expedition and Amundsen's South Pole expedition Terra Nova bore Robert Falcon Scott and his team on their ill-fated expedition to the South Pole . <p>The prize of the Heroic age was to reach the South Pole . Two expeditions set off in 1910 to attain this goal ; a party led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram and Robert Falcon Scott's British group from the Terra Nova . </p><p>Amundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier . [54][55][56] </p><p>Scott and his four companions reached the South Pole via the Beardmore route on 17 January 1912 , 33 days after Amundsen . All five died on the return journey from the Pole , through a combination of starvation and cold . [57] The Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station was later named after these two men . </p> <h3>Further expeditions[edit]</h3> The Main Base Hut of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition <p>The Australasian Antarctic Expedition took place between 1911\u20131914 and was led by Sir Douglas Mawson . It concentrated on the stretch of Antarctic coastline between Cape Adare and Mount Gauss , carrying out mapping and survey work on coastal and inland territories . </p><p>Discoveries included Commonwealth Bay , Ninnis Glacier , Mertz Glacier , and Queen Mary Land . Major accomplishments were made in geology , glaciology and terrestrial biology . [58] </p> As time wore on it became more and more evident that the ship was doomed by Frank Hurley . ( The Endurance trapped in pack ice . ) <p>The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u20131917 was led by Ernest Shackleton and set out to cross the continent via the South pole . However , their ship , the Endurance , was trapped and crushed by pack ice in the Weddell Sea before they were able to land . The expedition members survived after a journey on sledges over pack ice , a prolonged drift on an ice-floe , and a voyage in three small boats to Elephant Island . Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean in an open boat called James Caird and made the first crossing of South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken . [59] </p><p>A related component of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was the Ross Sea party , led by Aeneas Mackintosh . Its objective was to lay depots across the Great Ice Barrier , in order to supply Shackleton's party crossing from the Weddell Sea . All the required depots were laid , but in the process three men , including the leader Mackintosh , lost their lives . [60] </p><p>Shackleton's last expedition and the one that brought the 'Heroic Age' to a close , was the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition from 1921\u201322 on board the ship Quest . Its vaguely defined objectives included coastal mapping , a possible continental circumnavigation , the investigation of sub-Antarctic islands , and oceanographic work . After Shackleton's death on 5 January 1922 , Quest completed a shortened programme before returning home . | [61] </p> <h2>Further exploration[edit]</h2> <h3>By air[edit]</h3> Sir Hubert Wilkins pioneered the exploration of the Arctic regions by aircraft . Pictured , his plane and encampment as part of the Detroit Arctic Expedition , 1926 . <p>After Shackleton's last expedition , there was a hiatus in Antarctic exploration for about seven years . From 1929 , aircraft and mechanized transportation were increasingly used , earning this period the sobriquet of the 'Mechanical Age' . Hubert Wilkins first visited Antarctica in 1921\u20131922 as an ornithologist attached to the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition . From 1927 , Wilkins and pilot Carl Ben Eielson began exploring the Arctic by aircraft . [62] </p><p>On 15 April 1928 , only a year after Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic , Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from Point Barrow , Alaska , to Spitsbergen , arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April , touching along the way at Grant Land on Ellesmere Island . [63] For this feat and his prior work , Wilkins was knighted . </p><p>With financial backing from William Randolph Hearst , Wilkins returned to the South Pole and flew over Antarctica in the San Francisco . He named the island of Hearst Land after his sponsor . </p><p>US Navy Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd led five expeditions to Antarctica during the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s . He overflew the South Pole with pilot Bernt Balchen on 28 and 29 November 1929 , to match his overflight of the North Pole in 1926 . Byrd's explorations had science as a major objective and extensively used the aircraft to explore the continent . </p><p>Captain Finn Ronne , Byrd's executive officer , returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947\u20131948 , with Navy support , three planes , and dogs . Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent , i . e . that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected . [64] The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline , and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf , named by Ronne after his wife Edith Ronne . [65] Ronne covered 3 , 600 miles by ski and dog sled\u2014more than any other explorer in history . [66] </p> <h3>Overland crossing[edit]</h3> Main article : Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition Edmund Hillary ( left ) with Rear-Admiral George J . Dufek at Scott Base just before the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition's departure from the base . <p>The 1955\u201358 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition successfully completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica , via the South Pole . Although supported by the British and other Commonwealth governments , most of the funding came from corporate and individual donations . </p><p>It was headed by British explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs , with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team . After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base , Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957 , with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles ; three Sno-Cats , two Weasels and one specially adapted Muskeg tractor . En route , the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings . </p><p>In parallel Hillary's team had set up Scott Base\u00a0\u2013 which was to be Fuchs' final destination\u00a0\u2013 on the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea . Using three converted Massey Ferguson TE20 tractors[67] and one Weasel ( abandoned part-way ) , Hillary and his three men ( Ron Balham , Peter Mulgrew and Murray Ellis ) , were responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the Skelton Glacier and across the Polar Plateau on towards the South Pole , for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey . Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas . </p><p>Hillary's party reached the South Pole on 3 January 1958 , and was just the third ( preceded by Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912 ) to reach the Pole overland . Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958 , where they met up with Hillary . Fuchs then continued overland , following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base , completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole . [16] </p> <h2>Political history[edit]</h2> <h3>British claims[edit]</h3> <p>The United Kingdom reasserted sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in the far South Atlantic in 1833 and maintained a continuous presence there . In 1908 , the British government extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over \"South Georgia , the South Orkneys , the South Shetlands , and the Sandwich Islands , and Graham's Land , situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude , and lying between the 20th and the 80th degrees of west longitude\" . [68] All these territories were administered as Falkland Islands Dependencies from Stanley by the Governor of the Falkland Islands . The motivation for this declaration lay in the need for regulating and taxing the whaling industry effectively . Commercial operators would hunt whales in areas outside of the official boundaries of the Falkland Islands and its dependencies and there was a need to close this loophole . </p><p>In 1917 , the wording of the claim was modified , so as to , among other things , unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the South Pole ( thus encompassing all of the present-day British Antarctic Territory ) . The new claim covered \"all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the 50th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude ; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 58th parallel of south latitude\" . [68] </p><p>Under the ambition of Leopold Amery , the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies , Britain attempted to incorporate the entire continent into the Empire . In a memorandum to the governor-generals for Australia and New Zealand , he wrote that 'with the exception of Chile and Argentina and some barren islands belonging to France . . . it is desirable that the whole of the Antarctic should ultimately be included in the British Empire . ' </p><p>The first step was taken on 30 July 1923 , when the British government passed an Order in Council under the British Settlements Act 1887 , defining the new borders for the Ross Dependency - \"that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas , which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency . \" </p><p>The Order in Council then went on to appoint the Governor-General and Commander-in Chief of New Zealand as the Governor of the territory . [69] </p><p>In 1930 , the United Kingdom claimed Enderby Land . In 1933 , a British imperial order transferred territory south of 60\u00b0 S and between meridians 160\u00b0 E and 45\u00b0 E to Australia as the Australian Antarctic Territory . [70][71] </p><p>Following the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , the government of the United Kingdom relinquished all control over the government of New Zealand and Australia . This however had no bearing on the obligations of the Governor-General of both countries in their capacity as Governor of the Antarctic territories . </p> <h3>Other European claims[edit]</h3> Discovery by Jules Dumont d'Urville of Ad\u00e9lie Land in 1840 . This served as a basis for the French claim to this region in 1924 . <p>Meanwhile , alarmed by these unilateral declarations , the French government laid claim to a strip of the continent in 1924 . The basis for their claim to Ad\u00e9lie Land lay on the discovery of the coastline in 1840 by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville , who named it after his wife , Ad\u00e8le . [72] The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between Ad\u00e9lie Land and Australian Antarctic Territory was fixed definitively in 1938 . [73] </p><p>These developments also concerned Norwegian whaling interests , who wished to avoid the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic and were concerned that they would be commercially excluded from the continent . The whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic with the view to claim land for Norway and establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges . [74] The first expedition , led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad , landed on Peter I Island in 1929 and claimed the island for Norway . On 6 March 1931 , a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty[74] and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency . [75] </p><p>The 1929 expedition led by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn L\u00fctzow-Holm named the continental land mass near the island as Queen Maud Land , named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales . [76] The territory was explored further during the Norvegia expedition of 1930\u201331 . [77] Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20\u00b0W . [77] </p> Norwegian expedition landing on the Peter I Island in 1929 . <p>Norway's claim was disputed by Nazi Germany , [78] which in 1938 dispatched the German Antarctic Expedition , led by Alfred Ritscher , to fly over as much of it as possible . [77] The ship Schwabenland reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939 . [79] During the expedition , an area of about 350 , 000 square kilometres ( 140 , 000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi ) was photographed from the air by Ritscher , [80] who dropped darts inscribed with swastikas every 26 kilometres ( 16\u00a0mi ) . Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name New Swabia , but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the Second World War . [78] </p><p>On 14 January 1939 , five days prior to the German arrival , Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway , [76] after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the Falkland Islands Dependencies in the west and the Australian Antarctic Dependency in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty . [77] The primary basis for the annexation was to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region . [76][81] In 1948 , Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to from 20\u00b0W to 45\u00b0E , and that the Bruce Coast and Coats Land were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory . [77] </p> <h3>South American involvement[edit]</h3> Omond House was built in 1904 by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition as the first permanent base in Antarctica . It was later sold to Argentina . <p>This encroachment of foreign powers was a matter of immense disquiet to the nearby South American countries , Argentina and Chile . Taking advantage of a European continent plunged into turmoil with the onset of the Second World War , Chile's president , Pedro Aguirre Cerda declared the establishment of a Chilean Antarctic Territory in areas already claimed by Britain . </p><p>Argentina had an even longer history of involvement in the Continent . Already in 1904 the Argentine government began a permanent occupation in the area with the purchase of a meteorological station on Laurie Island established in 1903 by Dr William S . Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition . Bruce offered to transfer the station and instruments for the sum of 5 . 000 pesos , on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission . [82] British officer William Haggard also sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister , Jose Terry , ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition . [82] </p><p>In 1906 , Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on South Orkney Islands . However , Haggard responded by reminding Argentina that the South Orkneys were British . The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year . The Argentine government entered into negotiations with the British in 1913 over the possible transfer of the island . Although these talks were unsuccessful , Argentina attempted to unilaterally establish their sovereignty with the erection of markers , national flags and other symbols . [83] Finally , with British attention elsewhere , Argentina declared the establishment of Argentine Antarctica in 1943 , claiming territory that overlapped with British ( 20\u00b0W to 80\u00b0W ) and the earlier Chilean ( 53\u00b0W to 90\u00b0W ) claims . </p><p>In response to this and earlier German explorations , the British Admiralty and Colonial Office launched Operation Tabarin in 1943 to reassert British territorial claims against Argentine and Chilean incursion and establish a permanent British presence in the Antarctic . [84] The move was also motivated by concerns within the Foreign Office about the direction of United States post-war activity in the region . </p><p>A suitable cover story was the need to deny use of the area to the enemy . The Kriegsmarine was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders , U-boats and supply ships . Also , in 1941 , there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands , either as a base or to hand them over to Argentina , thus gaining political advantage for the Axis and denying their use to Britain . </p><p>In 1943 , British personnel from HMS Carnarvon Castle[85] removed Argentine flags from Deception Island . The expedition was led by Lieutenant James Marr and left the Falkland Islands in two ships , HMS William Scoresby ( a minesweeping trawler ) and Fitzroy , on Saturday 29 January 1944 . </p><p>Bases were established during February near the abandoned Norwegian whaling station on Deception Island , where the Union Flag was hoisted in place of Argentine flags , and at Port Lockroy ( on February 11 ) on the coast of Graham Land . A further base was founded at Hope Bay on 13 February 1945 , after a failed attempt to unload stores on 7 February 1944 . Symbols of British sovereignty , including post offices , signposts and plaques were also constructed and postage stamps were issued . </p><p>Operation Tabarin provoked Chile to organize its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947\u201348 , where the Chilean president Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla personally inaugurated one of its bases . [86] </p><p>Following the end of the war in 1945 , the British bases were handed over to civilian members of the newly created Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey ( subsequently the British Antarctic Survey ) the first such national scientific body to be established in Antarctica . </p> <h3>Post war developments[edit]</h3> Hut built at Hope Bay in 1903 . It was there that the only instance of shots fired in anger on the Continent occurred in 1952 . <p>Friction between Britain and the Latin American states continued into the post war period . Royal Navy warships were despatched in 1948 to prevent naval incursions and in 1952 , an Argentine shore party at Hope Bay ( the British Base \"D\" , established there in 1945 , came up against the Argentine Esperanza Base , est . 1952 ) fired a machine gun over the heads of a British Antarctic Survey team unloading supplies from the John Biscoe . The Argentines later extended a diplomatic apology , saying that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Argentine military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority . </p><p>The United States became politically interested in the Antarctic continent before and during WWII . The United States Antarctic Service Expedition , from 1939\u20131941 , was sponsored by the government with additional support came from donations and gifts by private citizens , corporations and institutions . The objectives of the Expedition , outlined by President Franklin D . Roosevelt , was to establish two bases : East Base , in the vicinity of Charcot Island , and West Base , in the vicinity of King Edward VII Land . After operating successfully for two years , but with international tensions on the rise , it was considered wise to evacuate the two bases . [87] </p><p>However , immediately after the war , American interest was rekindled with an explicitly geopolitical motive . Operation Highjump , from 1946\u20131947 was organized by Rear Admiral Richard E . Byrd Jr . and included 4 , 700 men , 13 ships , and multiple aircraft . The primary mission of Operation Highjump was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV , [88] for the purpose of training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions and amplifying existing stores of knowledge of hydrographic , geographic , geological , meteorological and electromagnetic propagation conditions in the area . The mission was also aimed at consolidating and extending United States sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent , although this was publicly denied as a goal even before the expedition ended . </p> <h3>Towards an international treaty[edit]</h3> The International Geophysical Year was pivotal in establishing a cooperative international framework in Antarctica , and led on to the Antarctic Treaty System in 1959 . <p>Meanwhile , in an attempt at ending the impasse , Britain submitted an application to the International Court of Justice in 1955 to adjudicate between the territorial claims of Britain , Argentina and Chile . This proposal failed , as both Latin American countries rejected submitting to an international arbitration procedure . [89] </p><p>Negotiations towards the establishment of an international condominium over the continent first began in 1948 , involving the 7 claimant powers ( Britain , Australia , New Zealand , France , Norway , Chile and Argentina ) and the US . This attempt was aimed at excluding the Soviet Union from the affairs of the continent and rapidly fell apart when the USSR declared an interest in the region , refused to recognize any claims of sovereignty and reserved the right to make its own claims in 1950 . [89] </p><p>An important impetus toward the formation of the Antarctic Treaty System in 1959 , was the International Geophysical Year , 1957\u20131958 . This year of international scientific cooperation triggered an 18-month period of intense Antarctic science . More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees , and participated in the cooperative effort . The British established Halley Research Station in 1956 by an expedition from the Royal Society . Sir Vivian Fuchs headed the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition , which completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958 . In Japan , the Japan Maritime Safety Agency offered ice breaker S\u014dya as the South Pole observation ship and Showa Station was built as the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica . </p><p>France contributed with Dumont d'Urville Station and Charcot Station in Ad\u00e9lie Land . The ship Commandant Charcot of the French Navy spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land , performing ionospheric soundings . [90] The US erected the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station as the first permanent structure directly over the South Pole in January 1957 . [91] </p><p>Finally , to prevent the possibility of military conflict in the region , the United States , United Kingdom , the Soviet Union and 9 other countries with significant interests negotiated and signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 . The treaty entered into force in 1961 and sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve , established freedom of scientific investigation and banned military activity on that continent . The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War . [92] </p> <h2>Recent history[edit]</h2> MS Explorer in Antarctica in January 1999 . She sank on 23 November 2007 after hitting an iceberg . <p>A baby , named Emilio Marcos de Palma , was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978 , becoming the first baby born on the continent . He also was born farther south than anyone in history . [93] </p><p>On 28 November 1979 , an Air New Zealand DC-10 on a sightseeing trip crashed into Mount Erebus on Ross Island , killing all 257 people on board . </p><p>In 1991 a convention among member nations of the Antarctic Treaty on how to regulate mining and drilling was proposed . Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and French Prime Minister Michel Rocard led a response to this convention that resulted in the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty , now known as the Madrid Protocol . All mineral extraction was banned for 50 years and the Antarctic was set aside as a \"natural reserve , devoted to peace and science\" . [94] </p><p>B\u00f8rge Ousland , a Norwegian explorer , finished the first unassisted Antarctic solo crossing on 18 January 1997 . </p><p>On 23 November 2007 , the MS Explorer struck an iceberg and sank , but all on board were rescued by nearby ships , including a passing Norwegian cruise ship , the MS Nordnorge . </p> <h2>Women in Antarctica[edit]</h2> Main article : Women in Antarctica First women at the South Pole are Pam Young , Jean Pearson , Lois Jones , Eileen McSaveney , Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill . <p>Women were originally kept from exploring Antarctica until well into the 1950s . A few pioneering women visited the Antarctic land and waters prior to the 1950s and many women requested to go on early expeditions , but were turned away . [95] Early pioneers such as Louise S\u00e9guin[96] and Ingrid Christensen were some of the first women to see Antarctic waters . [97] Christensen was the first woman to set foot on the mainland of Antarctica . [97] The first women to have any fanfare about their Antarctic journeys were Caroline Mikkelsen who set foot on an island of Antarctica in 1935 , [98] and Jackie Ronne and Jennie Darlington who were the first women to over-winter in Antarctica in 1947 . [99] The first woman scientist to work in Antarctica was Maria Klenova in 1956 . [100] Silvia Morella de Palma was the first woman to give birth in Antarctica , delivering 3 . 4\u00a0kg ( 7\u00a0lb 8 oz ) Emilio Palma at the Argentine Esperanza base 7 January 1978 . </p><p>Women faced legal barriers and sexism that prevented most from visiting Antarctica and doing research until the late 1960s . The United States Congress banned American women from traveling to Antarctica until 1969 . [101] Women were often excluded because it was thought that they could not handle the extreme temperatures or crisis situations . [102] The first woman from the British Antarctic Survey to go to Antarctica was Janet Thomson in 1983 who described the ban on women as a \"rather improper segregation . \"[103][104] </p><p>Once women were allowed in Antarctica , they still had to fight against sexism and sexual harassment . [105][106] However , a tipping point was reached in the mid 1990s when it became the new normal that women were part of Antarctic life . [107] Women began to see a change as more and more women began working and researching in Antarctica .

He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history , and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history . [2][3] </p><p>He was born Napoleone Buonaparte ( Italian : \u00a0[napole\u02c8o\u02d0ne \u02ccbw\u0254na\u02c8parte] ) in Corsica to a relatively modest Italian family from minor nobility . He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789 . He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24 . The French Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed the 13 Vend\u00e9miaire revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"sister republics\" with local support , and becoming a war hero in France . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power . He orchestrated a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic . After the Peace of Amiens in 1802 , Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies . He sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States , and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies . However , while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean , Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue Saint-Domingue , and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as Haiti in 1804 . Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further , and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804 . Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805 . Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph over the Russian Empire and Austrian Empire at the Battle of Austerlitz which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire . In 1806 , the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent . Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt , then marched his Grande Arm\u00e9e deep into Eastern Europe and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the Battle of Friedland . France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the Treaties of Tilsit in July 1807 , bringing an uneasy peace to the continent . Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire . In 1809 , the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition , but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram in July . </p><p>Napoleon then occupied the Iberian Peninsula , hoping to extend the Continental System and choke off British trade with the European mainland , and declared his brother Joseph Bonaparte the King of Spain in 1808 . The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support . The Peninsular War lasted six years , featured extensive guerrilla warfare , and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon . The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states , especially Russia . The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System , enticing Napoleon into another war . The French launched a major invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812 . The campaign destroyed Russian cities , but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted . It resulted in the collapse of the Grande Arm\u00e9e and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies . In 1813 , Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the War of the Sixth Coalition against France . A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813 , but his tactical victory at the minor Battle of Hanau allowed retreat onto French soil . The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814 , forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April . He was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Tuscany , and the Bourbon dynasty was restored to power . Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again . The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition which defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in June . The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic , where he died six years later at the age of 51 . </p><p>Napoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled , such as the Low Countries , Switzerland , and large parts of modern Italy and Germany . He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe . His Napoleonic Code has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world . British historian Andrew Roberts states : \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy , equality before the law , property rights , religious toleration , modern secular education , sound finances , and so on\u2014were championed , consolidated , codified and geographically extended by Napoleon . To them he added a rational and efficient local administration , an end to rural banditry , the encouragement of science and the arts , the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire\" .

[5] Napoleon boasted of his Italian heritage saying \"I am of the race that founds empires\" , and he referred to himself as \"more Italian or Tuscan than Corsican\" . [6] His parents Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino maintained an ancestral home called \"Casa Buonaparte\" in Ajaccio . Napoleon was born there on 15 August 1769 , their fourth child and third son . A boy and girl were born first but died in infancy . He had an elder brother , Joseph , and younger siblings Lucien , Elisa , Louis , Pauline , Caroline , and J\u00e9r\u00f4me . Napoleon was baptised as a Catholic . [7] Although he was born Napoleone di Buonaparte , [8] he changed his name to Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte when he was 27 in 1796 upon his first marriage . [a] </p><p>Napoleon was born the same year the Republic of Genoa , a former commune of Italy , [12] transferred Corsica to France . [13] The state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth in 1768 , and the island was conquered by France during the year of his birth and formally incorporated as a province in 1770 , after 500 years under Genoese rule and 14 years of independence . [b] Napoleon's parents fought against the French to maintain independence even when Maria was pregnant with him . His father was an attorney who went on to be named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777 . [17] </p><p>The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother , whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child . [17] Later in life Napoleon stated , \"The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother . \"[18] Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage , and Napoleon's uncle , the cardinal Joseph Fesch , would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years . Napoleon's noble , moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time . [19] </p><p>When he turned 9 years old , [20][21] he moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious school in Autun in January 1779 . In May , he transferred with a scholarship to a military academy at Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau . [22] In his youth he was an outspoken Corsican nationalist and supported the state's independence from France . [20] Like many Corsicans , Napoleon spoke and read Corsican ( as his mother tongue ) and Italian ( as the official language of Corsica ) . [23][24][25] He began learning French in school at around age 10 . [26] Although he became fluent in French , he spoke with a distinctive Corsican accent and never learned how to spell French correctly . [27] He was , however , not an isolated case , as it was estimated in 1790 that fewer than 3 million people , out of France's population of 28 million , were able to speak standard French , and those who could write it were even fewer . [28] </p><p>Napoleon was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent , birthplace , short stature , mannerisms and inability to speak French quickly . [24] Bonaparte became reserved and melancholy applying himself to reading . An examiner observed that Napoleon \"has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics . He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography\u00a0 . . . This boy would make an excellent sailor\" . [c][30] In early adulthood , he briefly intended to become a writer ; he authored a history of Corsica and a romantic novella . [20] </p><p>On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784 , Napoleon was admitted to the \u00c9cole Militaire in Paris . He trained to become an artillery officer and , when his father's death reduced his income , was forced to complete the two-year course in one year . [31] He was the first Corsican to graduate from the \u00c9cole Militaire . [31] He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace . [32] </p> <h2>Early career</h2> Napoleon Bonaparte , aged 23 , as lieutenant-colonel of a battalion of Corsican Republican volunteers . Portrait by Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux <p>Upon graduating in September 1785 , Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La F\u00e8re artillery regiment . [d][22] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 , and took nearly two years' leave in Corsica and Paris during this period . At this time , he was a fervent Corsican nationalist , and wrote to Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli in May 1789 , \"As the nation was perishing I was born . Thirty thousand Frenchmen were vomited on to our shores , drowning the throne of liberty in waves of blood . Such was the odious sight which was the first to strike me\" . [34] </p><p>He spent the early years of the Revolution in Corsica , fighting in a complex three-way struggle among royalists , revolutionaries , and Corsican nationalists . He was a supporter of the republican Jacobin movement , organizing clubs in Corsica , [35] and was given command over a battalion of volunteers . He was promoted to captain in the regular army in July 1792 , despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against French troops . [36] </p><p>He came into conflict with Paoli , who had decided to split with France and sabotage the Corsican contribution to the Exp\u00e9dition de Sardaigne , by preventing a French assault on the Sardinian island of La Maddalena . [37] Bonaparte and his family fled to the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli . [38] </p> <h3>Siege of Toulon</h3> Main article : Siege of Toulon Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon <p>In July 1793 , Bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet entitled Le souper de Beaucaire ( Supper at Beaucaire ) which gained him the support of Augustin Robespierre , younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre . With the help of his fellow Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti , Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon . [39] </p><p>He adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate . The assault on the position led to the capture of the city , but during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh . He was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 24 . Catching the attention of the Committee of Public Safety , he was put in charge of the artillery of France's Army of Italy . [40] </p><p>Napoleon spent time as inspector of coastal fortifications on the Mediterranean coast near Marseille while he was waiting for confirmation of the Army of Italy post . He devised plans for attacking the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition . Augustin Robespierre and Saliceti were ready to listen to the freshly promoted artillery general . [41] </p><p>The French army carried out Bonaparte's plan in the Battle of Saorgio in April 1794 , and then advanced to seize Ormea in the mountains . From Ormea , they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge . After this campaign , Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to determine that country's intentions towards France . [42] </p> <h3>13 Vend\u00e9miaire</h3> Main article : 13 Vend\u00e9miaire <p>Some contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under house arrest at Nice for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794 , but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs . According to Bourrienne , jealousy was responsible , between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy ( with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time ) . [43] Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar Saliceti , and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing . [44] He was released within two weeks and , due to his technical skills , was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria . He also took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British , but the French were repulsed by the British Royal Navy . [45] </p><p>By 1795 , Bonaparte had become engaged to D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary , daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Clary . D\u00e9sir\u00e9e's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph . [46] In April 1795 , he was assigned to the Army of the West , which was engaged in the War in the Vend\u00e9e\u2014a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e , a region in west central France on the Atlantic Ocean . As an infantry command , it was a demotion from artillery general\u2014for which the army already had a full quota\u2014and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting . [47] </p> Journ\u00e9e du 13 Vend\u00e9miaire , artillery fire in front of the Church of Saint-Roch , Paris , Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 <p>He was moved to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan . [48] During this period , he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eug\u00e9nie , about a soldier and his lover , in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e . [49] On 15 September , Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the Vend\u00e9e campaign . He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects . [50] </p><p>On 3 October , royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention . [51] Paul Barras , a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction , knew of Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the Convention in the Tuileries Palace . Napoleon had seen the massacre of the King's Swiss Guard there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence . [22] </p><p>He ordered a young cavalry officer named Joachim Murat to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on 5 October 1795\u201413 Vend\u00e9miaire An IV in the French Republican Calendar ; 1 , 400 royalists died and the rest fled . [51] He had cleared the streets with \"a whiff of grapeshot\" , according to 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle in The French Revolution : A History . [52][53] </p><p>The defeat of the royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame , wealth , and the patronage of the new government , the Directory . Murat married one of Napoleon's sisters , becoming his brother-in-law ; he also served under Napoleon as one of his generals . Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy . [38] </p><p>Within weeks , he was romantically involved with Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais , the former mistress of Barras . The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony . [54] </p> <h3>First Italian campaign</h3> Main article : Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars Bonaparte at the Pont d'Arcole , by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros , ( c . 1801 ) , Mus\u00e9e du Louvre , Paris <p>Two days after the marriage , Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy . He immediately went on the offensive , hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene . In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign , he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks . The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war , the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua . The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege , but Napoleon defeated every relief effort , scoring victories at the battles of Castiglione , Bassano , Arcole , and Rivoli . The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy . At Rivoli , the Austrians lost up to 14 , 000 men while the French lost about 5 , 000 . [55] </p><p>The next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the Habsburg heartlands . French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the Archduke Charles in 1796 , but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault . In the first encounter between the two commanders , Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797 . The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to Leoben , about 100\u00a0km from Vienna , and finally decided to sue for peace . [56] The Treaty of Leoben , followed by the more comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio , gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries , and a secret clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria . Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender , ending 1 , 100 years of independence . He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark . [57] </p> Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797 <p>His application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs , such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry . He stated later in life : [when?] \"I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning . Look at Caesar ; he fought the first like the last\" . [58] </p><p>Bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the \"hinge\" of an enemy's weakened front . If he could not use his favourite envelopment strategy , he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge , swing round to fight one until it fled , then turn to face the other . [59] In this Italian campaign , Bonaparte's army captured 150 , 000 prisoners , 540 cannons , and 170 standards . [60] The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics . [61] </p><p>During the campaign , Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics . He founded two newspapers : one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France . [62] The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator . [63] Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there , another $12 million in precious metals and jewels . His forces also confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures . [64] </p><p>Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'\u00e9tat and purge the royalists on 4 September\u2014Coup of 18 Fructidor . This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte , who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria . These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio , and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero . [65] He met Talleyrand , France's new Foreign Minister\u2014who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon\u2014and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain . [38] </p> <h3>Egyptian expedition</h3> Main article : French campaign in Egypt and Syria Bonaparte Before the Sphinx ( c . 1886 ) by Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me , Hearst Castle Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July 1798 by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois , Baron Lejeune , 1808 <p>After two months of planning , Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy . He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India . [38] Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East , linking with Tipu Sultan , the Sultan of Mysore and an enemy of the British in India . [66] Napoleon assured the Directory that \"as soon as he had conquered Egypt , he will establish relations with the Indian princes and , together with them , attack the English in their possessions\" . [67] The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to India . [68] </p><p>In May 1798 , Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences . His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists , with mathematicians , naturalists , chemists , and geodesists among them . Their discoveries included the Rosetta Stone , and their work was published in the Description de l'\u00c9gypte in 1809 . [69] </p><p>En route to Egypt , Bonaparte reached Malta on 9 June 1798 , then controlled by the Knights Hospitaller . Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim surrendered after token resistance , and Bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men . [70] </p><p>General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July . [38] He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks , Egypt's ruling military caste . This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids , fought on 21 July , about 24\u00a0km ( 15\u00a0mi ) from the pyramids . General Bonaparte's forces of 25 , 000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks' Egyptian cavalry . Twenty-nine French[71] and approximately 2 , 000 Egyptians were killed . The victory boosted the morale of the French army . [72] </p><p>On 1 August 1798 , the British fleet under Sir Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two French vessels in the Battle of the Nile , defeating Bonaparte's goal to strengthen the French position in the Mediterranean . [73] His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt , though it faced repeated uprisings . [74] In early 1799 , he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus ( Syria and Galilee ) . Bonaparte led these 13 , 000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish , Gaza , Jaffa , and Haifa . [75] The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal . Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war , ostensibly on parole , so he ordered the garrison and 1 , 400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets . [73] Men , women , and children were robbed and murdered for three days . [76] </p><p>Bonaparte began with an army of 13 , 000 men ; 1 , 500 were reported missing , 1 , 200 died in combat , and thousands perished from disease\u2014mostly bubonic plague . He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre , so he marched his army back to Egypt in May . To speed up the retreat , Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium ; the number who died remains disputed , ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 580 . He also brought out 1 , 000 wounded men . [77] Back in Egypt on 25 July , Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir . [78] </p> <h2>Ruler of France</h2> Main articles : 18 Brumaire and Napoleonic era General Bonaparte surrounded by members of the Council of Five Hundred during the Coup of 18 Brumaire , by Fran\u00e7ois Bouchot <p>While in Egypt , Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs . He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition . [79] On 24 August 1799 , he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France , despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris . [73] The army was left in the charge of Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber . [80] </p><p>Unknown to Bonaparte , the Directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of French soil , but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages . [79] By the time that he reached Paris in October , France's situation had been improved by a series of victories . The Republic , however , was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population . [81] The Directory discussed Bonaparte's \"desertion\" but was too weak to punish him . [79] </p><p>Despite the failures in Egypt , Napoleon returned to a hero's welcome . He drew together an alliance with director Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s , his brother Lucien , speaker of the Council of Five Hundred Roger Ducos , director Joseph Fouch\u00e9 , and Talleyrand , and they overthrew the Directory by a coup d'\u00e9tat on 9 November 1799 ( \"the 18th Brumaire\" according to the revolutionary calendar ) , closing down the Council of Five Hundred . Napoleon became \"first consul\" for ten years , with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only . His power was confirmed by the new \"Constitution of the Year VIII\" , originally devised by Siey\u00e8s to give Napoleon a minor role , but rewritten by Napoleon , and accepted by direct popular vote ( 3 , 000 , 000 in favour , 1 , 567 opposed ) . The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship . [82][83] </p> <h3>French Consulate</h3> Main articles : French Consulate and War of the Second Coalition Bonaparte , First Consul , by Ingres . Posing the hand inside the waistcoat was often used in portraits of rulers to indicate calm and stable leadership . <p>Napoleon established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called \"dictatorship by plebiscite\" . [84] Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution , but unwilling to ignore them entirely , Napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power . [84] He drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul , taking up residence at the Tuileries . The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January , with 99 . 94 percent officially listed as voting \"yes\" . [85] </p><p>Napoleon's brother , Lucien , had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite . The real number was 1 . 5 million . [84] Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people , so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate . [84] In the first few months of the Consulate , with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country , Napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous . [86] </p><p>In the spring of 1800 , Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy , aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt . [e] After a difficult crossing over the Alps , the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed . [88] While one French army approached from the north , the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa , which was besieged by a substantial force . The fierce resistance of this French army , under Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na , gave the northern force some time to carry out their operations with little interference . [89] </p> The Battle of Marengo was Napoleon's first great victory as head of state . <p>After spending several days looking for each other , the two armies collided at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June . General Melas had a numerical advantage , fielding about 30 , 000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24 , 000 French troops . [90] The battle began favourably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back . Melas stated that he had won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm , leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French . [91] The French lines never broke during their tactical retreat . Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight . [92] </p><p>Late in the afternoon , a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle . A series of artillery barrages and cavalry charges decimated the Austrian army , which fled over the Bormida River back to Alessandria , leaving behind 14 , 000 casualties . [92] The following day , the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria , which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region . [92] </p><p>Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle , they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy , choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west , near or along the coastline . [93] As Chandler points out , Napoleon spent almost a year getting the Austrians out of Italy in his first campaign . In 1800 , it took him only a month to achieve the same goal . [93] German strategist and field marshal Alfred von Schlieffen concluded that \"Bonaparte did not annihilate his enemy but eliminated him and rendered him harmless\" while \"[attaining] the object of the campaign : the conquest of North Italy\" . [94] </p><p>Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home , but it did not lead to an immediate peace . Bonaparte's brother , Joseph , led the complex negotiations in Lun\u00e9ville and reported that Austria , emboldened by British support , would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired . As negotiations became increasingly fractious , Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more . Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800 . As a result , the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville in February 1801 . The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio . [95] </p> Temporary peace in Europe See also : Haitian Revolution <p>After a decade of constant warfare , France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 , bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end . Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic . [89] With Europe at peace and the economy recovering , Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate , both domestically and abroad . [96] In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802 , the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent , essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life . [96] </p><p>Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1 . 5 million people to the polls , the new referendum enticed 3 . 6 million to go and vote ( 72 percent of all eligible voters ) . [97] There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime . The constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote . [97] His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution : Article 1 . The French people name , and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life . [98] After 1802 , he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte . [33] </p> The 1803 Louisiana Purchase totalled 2 , 144 , 480 square kilometres ( 827 , 987 square miles ) , doubling the size of the United States . <p>The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad . Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars , with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801 . Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens . In the 1780s , Saint-Domingue had been France's wealthiest colony , producing more sugar than all the British West Indies colonies put together . However , during the Revolution , the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794 . [99] Under the terms of Amiens , Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented . However , the 1794 decree was only implemented in Saint-Domingue , Guadeloupe and Guyane , and was a dead letter in Senegal , Mauritius , Reunion and Martinique , the last of which had been conquered by the British , who maintained the institution of slavery on that Caribbean island . [100] </p><p>In Guadeloupe , the 1794 law abolished slavery , and it was violently enforced by Victor Hugues against opposition from slaveholders . However , when slavery was reinstated in 1802 , there was a slave revolt by Louis Delgres . [101] The resulting Law of 20 May had the express purpose of reinstating slavery in Saint-Domingue , Guadeloupe and French Guiana , and restored slavery throughout the French Empire and its Caribbean colonies for another half a century , while the French trans-Atlantic slave trade continued for another twenty years . [102][103][104][105][106] </p><p>Napoleon sent an expedition under his brother-in-law General Leclerc to reassert control over Saint-Domingue . Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture , the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army , and Jean-Jacques Dessalines won a string of victories , first against Leclerc , and when he died from yellow fever , then against Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur , vicomte de Rochambeau , whom Napoleon sent to relieve Leclerc with another 20 , 000 men . In May 1803 , Napoleon acknowledged defeat , and the last 8 , 000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Ha\u00efti in 1804 . In the process , Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France . [107][108] Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts , Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States , instantly doubling the size of the U . S . The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre , a total of $15 million . [2][109] </p><p>The peace with Britain proved to be uneasy and controversial . [110] Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation , which established a new Swiss Confederation . Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens , but they inflamed tensions significantly . [111] The dispute culminated in a declaration of war by Britain in May 1803 ; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne . [73] </p> <h3>French Empire</h3> Main article : First French Empire See also : Coronation of Napoleon I and Napoleonic Wars The Coronation of Napoleon by Jacques-Louis David ( 1804 ) <p>During the Consulate , Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots , including the Conspiration des poignards ( Dagger plot ) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise ( also known as the Infernal Machine ) two months later . [112] In January 1804 , his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family , the former rulers of France . On the advice of Talleyrand , Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien , violating the sovereignty of Baden . The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial , even though he had not been involved in the plot . [113] Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe , becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars . </p><p>To expand his power , Napoleon used these assassination plots to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model . He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution . [114] Launching yet another referendum , Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99% . [97] As with the Life Consulate two years earlier , this referendum produced heavy participation , bringing out almost 3 . 6 million voters to the polls . [97] </p><p>A keen observer of Bonaparte's rise to absolute power , Madame de R\u00e9musat , explains that \"men worn out by the turmoil of the Revolution [\u2026] looked for the domination of an able ruler\" and that \"people believed quite sincerely that Bonaparte , whether as consul or emperor , would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy . [115]\" </p> Napoleon's throne room at Fontainebleau <p>Napoleon's coronation , officiated by Pope Pius VII , took place at Notre Dame de Paris , on 2 December 1804 . Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony : a golden laurel wreath recalling the Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown . [116] Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings . [116] For the official coronation , he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture , but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath . [116] Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head , the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David . [116] Napoleon was also crowned King of Italy , with the Iron Crown of Lombardy , at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805 . He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 May 1804 , the official start of the Empire . [citation needed] </p> War of the Third Coalition Main article : War of the Third Coalition Napoleon and the Grande Arm\u00e9e receive the surrender of Austrian General Mack after the Battle of Ulm in October 1805 . The decisive finale of the Ulm Campaign raised the tally of captured Austrian soldiers to 60 , 000 . With the Austrian army destroyed , Vienna would fall to the French in November . <p>Great Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803 . [117] In December 1804 , an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition . By April 1805 , Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia . [118] Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge , so it joined the coalition a few months later . [119] </p><p>Before the formation of the Third Coalition , Napoleon had assembled an invasion force , the Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre , around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France . He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England . They never invaded , but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations . [120] The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Arm\u00e9e . At the start , this French army had about 200 , 000 men organized into seven corps , which were large field units that contained 36\u201340 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue . [121] </p><p>A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support , giving the Grande Arm\u00e9e countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign . On top of these forces , Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22 , 000 organized into two cuirassier divisions , four mounted dragoon divisions , one division of dismounted dragoons , and one of light cavalry , all supported by 24 artillery pieces . [122] By 1805 , the Grande Arm\u00e9e had grown to a force of 350 , 000 men , [122] who were well equipped , well trained , and led by competent officers . [123] </p><p>Napoleon knew that the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a head-to-head battle , so he planned to lure it away from the English Channel through diversionary tactics . [124] The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies . In the face of this attack , it was hoped , the British would weaken their defence of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean , allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade . [124] However , the plan unravelled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805 . French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to C\u00e1diz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel . [125] </p><p>By August 1805 , Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally . Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies , he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine . His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive . On 25 September , after great secrecy and feverish marching , 200 , 000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260\u00a0km ( 160\u00a0mi ) . [126][127] </p><p>Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia . Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Arm\u00e9e performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions . The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack , who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off . After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm , Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement . For just 2 , 000 French casualties , Napoleon had managed to capture a total of 60 , 000 Austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching . [128] </p><p>The Ulm Campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century . [129] For the French , this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October . After Trafalgar , Britain had total domination of the seas for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars . [citation needed] </p> Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz , by Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard 1805 . The Battle of Austerlitz , also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors , was one of Napoleon's many victories , where the French Empire defeated the Third Coalition . <p>Following the Ulm Campaign , French forces managed to capture Vienna in November . The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100 , 000 muskets , 500 cannons , and the intact bridges across the Danube . [130] At this critical juncture , both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle , despite reservations from some of their subordinates . Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies , but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness . [131] </p><p>Desperate to lure the Allies into battle , Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state , even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz . At the Battle of Austerlitz , in Moravia on 2 December , he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank , enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line . A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time . [131] </p><p>Meanwhile , the heavy Allied deployment against the French right flank weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights , which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult . With the Allied center demolished , the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically , capturing thousands of prisoners in the process . The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan\u2014of the same stature as Cannae , the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2 , 000 years before . [131] </p><p>The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort . France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December . Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville between the two powers . The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria , and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies . It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil . Napoleon went on to say , \"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought\" . [132] Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality , and what used to be French foreign policy became a \"personal Napoleonic one\" . [133] Vincent Cronin disagrees , stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself , \"he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen\" . [134] </p> Middle-Eastern alliances Main articles : Franco-Ottoman alliance and Franco-Persian alliance The Iranian envoy Mirza Mohammed Reza-Qazvini meeting with Napoleon I at the Finckenstein Palace in West Prussia , 27 April 1807 , to sign the Treaty of Finckenstein <p>Napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia , and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire . [66] In February 1806 , Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognised Napoleon as Emperor . He also opted for an alliance with France , calling France \"our sincere and natural ally\" . [135] That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain . A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar . It collapsed in 1807 , when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance . [66] In the end , Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East . [136] </p> War of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit Main article : War of the Fourth Coalition <p>After Austerlitz , Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 . A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe , the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians . The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region , if not eliminating it outright . War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806 . At the insistence of his court , especially his wife Queen Louise , Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war . [137] </p> Napoleon reviewing the Imperial Guard before the Battle of Jena <p>The initial military manoeuvres began in September 1806 . In a letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign , Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ( \"square battalion\" ) . [138] In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system , the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance . [138] If any single corps was attacked , the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help . [139] </p><p>Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180 , 000 troops , rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale . As in previous campaigns , his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war . Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army , the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force . At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt , fought on 14 October , the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties . With several major commanders dead or incapacitated , the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army , which began to quickly disintegrate . [139] </p><p>In a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the \"peak of Napoleonic warfare\" , according to historian Richard Brooks , [139] the French managed to capture 140 , 000 soldiers , over 2 , 000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons , all in a single month . Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces : \"Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered\" . [138] Despite their overwhelming defeat , the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight . </p> The Treaties of Tilsit : Napoleon meeting with Alexander I of Russia on a raft in the middle of the Neman River <p>Following his triumph , Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806 . The Continental System , which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain , was widely violated throughout his reign . [140][141] In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . [142] After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . [143] </p><p>On 14 June Napoleon obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Tsar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated : \"I hate the English as much as you do\" . [143] </p><p>Alexander faced pressure from his brother , Duke Constantine , to make peace with Napoleon . Given the victory he had just achieved , the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System , withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia , and hand over the Ionian Islands to France . [144] By contrast , Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia , despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise . Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map , Napoleon created a new kingdom of 2 , 800 square kilometres ( 1 , 100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi ) called Westphalia and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch . Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed . Moreover , Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart , who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years . Despite these problems , the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France , which he had not seen in over 300 days . [145] </p> Peninsular War and Erfurt Main article : Peninsular War <p>The settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire . One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British . He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal , which consistently violated his trade prohibitions . After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801 , Portugal adopted a double-sided policy . At first , John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade . The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar ; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain . [citation needed] </p> Joseph Bonaparte , Napoleon's brother , as King of Spain <p>Unhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government , Napoleon negotiated a secret treaty with Charles IV of Spain and sent an army to invade Portugal . [146] On 17 October 1807 , 24 , 000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's orders . [147] This attack was the first step in what would eventually become the Peninsular War , a six-year struggle that significantly sapped French strength . Throughout the winter of 1808 , French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs , attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family . On 16 February 1808 , secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country . [148] </p><p>Marshal Murat led 120 , 000 troops into Spain . The French arrived in Madrid on 24 March , [149] where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later . Napoleon appointed his brother , Joseph Bonaparte , as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808 . The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population . Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain . The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bail\u00e9n in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person . [citation needed] </p><p>Before going to Iberia , Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians . At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808 , Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria . The two sides reached an agreement , the Erfurt Convention , that called upon Britain to cease its war against France , that recognized the Russian conquest of Finland from Sweden , and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\" . [150] </p><p>Napoleon then returned to France and prepared for war . The Grande Arm\u00e9e , under the Emperor's personal command , rapidly crossed the Ebro River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces . After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at Somosierra , Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80 , 000 troops . [151] He then unleashed his soldiers against Moore and the British forces . The British were swiftly driven to the coast , and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809 . [citation needed] </p> Napoleon accepting the surrender of Madrid , 4 December 1808 <p>Napoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe , but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence . He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign . Several months after Corunna , the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington . The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand . The highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside . Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict . [152] </p><p>The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain , largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe , severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication . Although France maintained roughly 300 , 000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War , the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations . [152] The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively , prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies . After the invasion of Russia in 1812 , the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe . By 1814 , after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia , the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula . [citation needed] </p><p>The impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the Spanish empire . In Spanish America many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII of Spain , whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch . The outbreak of the Spanish American wars of independence in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of strongmen in the wake of these wars . [153] </p> War of the Fifth Coalition and Marie Louise Main article : War of the Fifth Coalition Napoleon at the Battle of Wagram , painted by Horace Vernet <p>After four years on the sidelines , Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats . Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain , Sweden , and the Ottoman Empire in 1809 . Frederick William of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians , but reneged before conflict began . [154] A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized . [154] Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon , a stance that landed him in the so-called \"peace party\" , he did not want to see the army demobilized either . [154] On 8 February 1809 , the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French . [citation needed] </p><p>In the early morning of 10 April , leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria . The early Austrian attack surprised the French ; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion . He arrived at Donauw\u00f6rth on the 17th to find the Grande Arm\u00e9e in a dangerous position , with its two wings separated by 120\u00a0km ( 75\u00a0mi ) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops . Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout . In response , Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver . [155] He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckm\u00fchl . The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckm\u00fchl , forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia . On 13 May , Vienna fell for the second time in four years , although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany . </p> The entry of Napoleon in Sch\u00f6nbrunn , Vienna <p>By 17 May , the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld . Charles kept the bulk of his troops several kilometres away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross . On 21 May , the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube , precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling . The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle . On the first day , Charles disposed of 110 , 000 soldiers against only 31 , 000 commanded by Napoleon . [156] By the second day , reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70 , 000 . [157] </p><p>The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling , the focal points of the French bridgehead . By the end of the fighting , the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling . A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island . Both sides inflicted about 23 , 000 casualties on each other . [158] It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle , and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield . [159] </p><p>After the setback at Aspern-Essling , Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube . [160] From 30 June to the early days of July , the French recrossed the Danube in strength , with more than 180 , 000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians . [160] Charles received the French with 150 , 000 of his own men . [161] In the ensuing Battle of Wagram , which also lasted two days , Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then . Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat . Austrian losses were very heavy , reaching well over 40 , 000 casualties . [162] The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately , but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July . </p> The French Empire at its greatest extent in 1812 : \u00a0\u00a0French Empire\u00a0\u00a0French satellite states <p>In the Kingdom of Holland , the British launched the Walcheren Campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians . The British army only landed at Walcheren on 30 July , by which point the Austrians had already been defeated . The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed \"Walcheren Fever\" . Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign , and the rest withdrew in December 1809 . [163] The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians . Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with Napoleon . Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere , the Austrians agreed to peace talks . [citation needed] </p><p>The resulting Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory . Metternich and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the Habsburg Empire as their fundamental goal , and to this end they succeeded by making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers . [164] Nevertheless , while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm , France received Carinthia , Carniola , and the Adriatic ports , while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians . [164] Austria lost over three million subjects , about one-fifth of her total population , as a result of these territorial changes . [165] Although fighting in Iberia continued , the War of the Fifth Coalition would be the last major conflict on the European continent for the next three years . [citation needed] </p><p>Napoleon turned his focus to domestic affairs after the war . Empress Jos\u00e9phine had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon , who became worried about the future of his empire following his death . Desperate for a legitimate heir , Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife . Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection , Napoleon married the Marie Louise , Duchess of Parma , daughter of Francis II , who was 18 years old at the time . On 20 March 1811 , Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy , whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of King of Rome . His son never actually ruled the empire , but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on's subsequent naming himself Napol\u00e9on III , historians often refer to him as Napoleon II . [166] </p> Invasion of Russia Main article : French invasion of Russia <p>In 1808 , Napoleon and Tsar Alexander met at the Congress of Erfurt to preserve the Russo-French alliance . The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807 . [167] By 1811 , however , tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the Russian nobility to break off the alliance . [citation needed] A major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians , which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain . [168] </p> Napoleon watching the fire of Moscow in September 1812 , by Adam Albrecht ( 1841 ) Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia , painting by Adolph Northen <p>By 1812 , advisers to Alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland . On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations , Napoleon expanded his Grande Arm\u00e9e to more than 450 , 000 men . [169] He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign ; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced . [170] </p><p>In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots , Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War\u2014the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768 . Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created . This was rejected by Napoleon , who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen . Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear . The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat . [171] </p><p>The Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia . A brief attempt at resistance was made at Smolensk in August ; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles , and Napoleon resumed his advance . The Russians again avoided battle , although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose . Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics , the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses . [172] </p><p>The Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September : the Battle of Borodino resulted in approximately 44 , 000 Russian and 35 , 000 French dead , wounded or captured , and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time . [173] Although the French had won , the Russian army had accepted , and withstood , the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive . Napoleon's own account was : \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow . The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory , but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\" . [174] </p><p>The Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow . Napoleon entered the city , assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace . However , on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin , rather than capitulation , Moscow was burned . After five weeks , Napoleon and his army left . In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812 . His army walked through snow up to their knees , and nearly 10 , 000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone . After the Battle of Berezina Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train . On 5 December , shortly before arriving in Vilnius , Napoleon left the army in a sledge . [175] </p><p>The French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat , including from the harshness of the Russian Winter . The Arm\u00e9e had begun as over 400 , 000 frontline troops , with fewer than 40 , 000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812 . [176] The Russians had lost 150 , 000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians . [177] </p> War of the Sixth Coalition Main article : War of the Sixth Coalition Napoleon's farewell to his Imperial Guard , 20 April 1814 , by Antoine-Alphonse Montfort <p>There was a lull in fighting over the winter of 1812\u201313 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces ; Napoleon was able to field 350 , 000 troops . [178] Heartened by France's loss in Russia , Prussia joined with Austria , Sweden , Russia , Great Britain , Spain , and Portugal in a new coalition . Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813 . [179] </p><p>Despite these successes , the numbers continued to mount against Napoleon , and the French army was pinned down by a force twice its size and lost at the Battle of Leipzig . This was by far the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars and cost more than 90 , 000 casualties in total . [180] </p><p>The Allies offered peace terms in the Frankfurt proposals in November 1813 . Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France , but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\" . That meant that France could retain control of Belgium , Savoy and the Rhineland ( the west bank of the Rhine River ) , while giving up control of all the rest , including all of Spain and the Netherlands , and most of Italy and Germany . Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer ; after further victories , the terms would be harsher and harsher . Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats , while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars . [181] </p><p>Napoleon , expecting to win the war , delayed too long and lost this opportunity ; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer . When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals . The Allies now had new , harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries , which meant the loss of Belgium . Napoleon would remain Emperor , however he rejected the term . The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed , and they prevailed , but Napoleon adamantly refused . [181][182] </p> Napoleon after his abdication in Fontainebleau , 4 April 1814 , by Paul Delaroche <p>Napoleon withdrew back into France , his army reduced to 70 , 000 soldiers and little cavalry ; he faced more than three times as many Allied troops . [183] The French were surrounded : British armies pressed from the south , and other Coalition forces positioned to attack from the German states . Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign , though these were not significant enough to turn the tide . The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814 . [184] </p><p>On 1 April , Alexander addressed the S\u00e9nat conservateur . Long docile to Napoleon , under Talleyrand's prodding it had turned against him . Alexander told the S\u00e9nat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon , not France , and they were prepared to offer honourable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power . The next day , the S\u00e9nat passed the Acte de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'Empereur ( \"Emperor's Demise Act\" ) , which declared Napoleon deposed . Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost . When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital , his senior officers and marshals mutinied . [185] </p><p>On 4 April , led by Ney , they confronted Napoleon . Napoleon asserted the army would follow him , and Ney replied the army would follow its generals . While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on , without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible . Bowing to the inevitable , on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son , with Marie Louise as regent . However , the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander , who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne . [186] Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later . </p> Exile to Elba Napoleon leaving Elba on 26 February 1815 , by Joseph Beaume ( 1836 ) . mw-parser-output . templatequote{overflow : hidden ; margin : 1em 0 ; padding : 0 40px} . mw-parser-output . templatequote . templatequotecite{line-height : 1 . 5em ; text-align : left ; padding-left : 1 . 6em ; margin-top : 0}<p>The Allied Powers having declared that Emperor Napoleon was the sole obstacle to the restoration of peace in Europe , Emperor Napoleon , faithful to his oath , declares that he renounces , for himself and his heirs , the thrones of France and Italy , and that there is no personal sacrifice , even that of his life , which he is not ready to do in the interests of France . <br/>Done in the palace of Fontainebleau , 11 April 1814 . </p>\u2014\u2009Act of abdication of Napoleon[187] <p>In the Treaty of Fontainebleau , the Allies exiled Napoleon to Elba , an island of 12 , 000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean , 20\u00a0km ( 12\u00a0mi ) off the Tuscan coast . They gave him sovereignty over the island and allowed him to retain the title of Emperor . Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow . Its potency had weakened with age , however , and he survived to be exiled , while his wife and son took refuge in Austria . [188] </p><p>He was conveyed to the island on HMS Undaunted ( 1807 ) by Captain Thomas Ussher , he arrived at Portoferraio on 30 May 1814 . In the first few months on Elba he created a small navy and army , developed the iron mines , oversaw the construction of new roads , issued decrees on modern agricultural methods , and overhauled the island's legal and educational system . [189][190] </p><p>A few months into his exile , Napoleon learned that his ex-wife Josephine had died in France . He was devastated by the news , locking himself in his room and refusing to leave for two days . [191] </p> Hundred Days Main article : Hundred Days Napoleon\u2019s Return from Elba , by Charles de Steuben , 1818 <p>Separated from his wife and son , who had returned to Austria , cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau , and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean , [192] Napoleon escaped from Elba , in the brig Inconstant on 26 February 1815 with 700 men . [192] Two days later , he landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and started heading north . [192] </p><p>The 5th Regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact just south of Grenoble on 7 March 1815 . Napoleon approached the regiment alone , dismounted his horse and , when he was within gunshot range , shouted to the soldiers , \"Here I am . Kill your Emperor , if you wish\" . [193] The soldiers quickly responded with , \"Vive L'Empereur!\" Ney , who had boasted to the restored Bourbon king , Louis XVIII , that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage , affectionately kissed his former emperor and forgot his oath of allegiance to the Bourbon monarch . The two then marched together towards Paris with a growing army . The unpopular Louis XVIII fled to Belgium after realizing he had little political support . On 13 March , the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw . Four days later , Great Britain , Russia , Austria , and Prussia each pledged to put 150 , 000 men into the field to end his rule . [194] </p><p>Napoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days . By the start of June the armed forces available to him had reached 200 , 000 , and he decided to go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming British and Prussian armies . The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands , in modern-day Belgium . [195] </p><p>Napoleon's forces fought two Coalition armies , commanded by the British Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Prince Bl\u00fccher , at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 . Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French and drove them from the field while the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank . </p><p>Napoleon returned to Paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him . Realizing his position was untenable , he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son . He left Paris three days later and settled at Josephine's former palace in Malmaison ( on the western bank of the Seine about 17 kilometres ( 11\u00a0mi ) west of Paris ) . Even as Napoleon travelled to Paris , the Coalition forces swept through France ( arriving in the vicinity of Paris on 29 June ) , with the stated intent of restoring Louis XVIII to the French throne . </p><p>When Napoleon heard that Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive , he fled to Rochefort , considering an escape to the United States . British ships were blocking every port . Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland on HMS\u00a0Bellerophon on 15 July 1815 . [196] </p> <h2>Exile on Saint Helena</h2> Napoleon on Saint Helena , watercolor by Franz Josef Sandmann , c . \u20091820 Longwood House , Saint Helena , site of Napoleon's captivity <p>The British kept Napoleon on the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean , 1 , 870\u00a0km ( 1 , 162\u00a0mi ) from the west coast of Africa . They also took the precaution of sending a garrison of soldiers to uninhabited Ascension Island , which lay between St . Helena and Europe . [197] </p><p>Napoleon was moved to Longwood House on Saint Helena in December 1815 ; it had fallen into disrepair , and the location was damp , windswept and unhealthy . [198][199] The Times published articles insinuating the British government was trying to hasten his death . Napoleon often complained of the living conditions in letters to the governor and his custodian , Hudson Lowe , [200] while his attendants complained of \"colds , catarrhs , damp floors and poor provisions . \"[201] It has been speculated by modern scientists that his later illness arose from arsenic poisoning caused by copper arsenite in the wallpaper at Longwood House . [202] </p><p>With a small cadre of followers , Napoleon dictated his memoirs and grumbled about conditions . Lowe cut Napoleon's expenditure , ruled that no gifts were allowed if they mentioned his imperial status , and made his supporters sign a guarantee they would stay with the prisoner indefinitely . [203] </p><p>While in exile , Napoleon wrote a book about Julius Caesar , one of his great heroes . [204] He also studied English under the tutelage of Count Emmanuel de Las Cases with the main aim of being able to read English newspapers and books , as access to French newspapers and books was heavily restricted to him on Saint Helena . [205] </p><p>There were rumours of plots and even of his escape , but in reality no serious attempts were made . [206] For English poet Lord Byron , Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero , the persecuted , lonely , and flawed genius . [207] </p> <h3>Death</h3> Further information : Death mask of Napoleon and Retour des cendres Bronze death mask of Napoleon I , modelled in 1821 , cast in 1833 <p>Napoleon's personal physician , Barry O'Meara , warned London that his declining state of health was mainly caused by the harsh treatment . Napoleon confined himself for months on end in his damp and wretched habitation of Longwood . [208] </p><p>In February 1821 , Napoleon's health began to deteriorate rapidly , and he reconciled with the Catholic Church . He died on 5 May 1821 , after confession , Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali . His last words were , France , l'arm\u00e9e , t\u00eate d'arm\u00e9e , Jos\u00e9phine ( \"France , the army , head of the army , Jos\u00e9phine\" ) . [209][210] </p><p>Napoleon's original death mask was created around 6 May , although it is not clear which doctor created it . [f][212] In his will , he had asked to be buried on the banks of the Seine , but the British governor said he should be buried on Saint Helena , in the Valley of the Willows . [209] </p> Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides in Paris <p>In 1840 , Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British to return Napoleon's remains to France . On 15 December 1840 , a state funeral was held . The hearse proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , across the Place de la Concorde to the Esplanade des Invalides and then to the cupola in St J\u00e9r\u00f4me's Chapel , where it remained until the tomb designed by Louis Visconti was completed . </p><p>In 1861 , Napoleon's remains were entombed in a porphyry stone sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides . [213] </p> Cause of death <p>The cause of his death has been debated . Napoleon's physician , Fran\u00e7ois Carlo Antommarchi , led the autopsy , which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer . Antommarchi did not sign the official report . [214] Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer , although this was apparently unknown at the time of the autopsy . [215] Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer ; this was the most convenient explanation for the British , who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon . [209] </p> Napoleon on His Death Bed , by Horace Vernet , 1826 <p>In 1955 , the diaries of Napoleon's valet , Louis Marchand , were published . His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death , including deliberate arsenic poisoning . [216] Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period . Furthermore , in a 1978 book with Ben Weider , Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840 . Arsenic is a strong preservative , and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis . Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring . [216] </p><p>They maintained that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison . Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose , which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind . [216] According to a 2007 article , the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral , the most toxic , and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz , this supported the conclusion that he was murdered . [217] </p><p>There have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding . [217] In a 2008 study , researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life , as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries . All samples had high levels of arsenic , approximately 100 times higher than the current average . According to these researchers , Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy , and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning ; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives . [g] Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning , and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death . [219] </p> <h2>Religion</h2> Further information : Napoleon and the Catholic Church Reorganisation of the religious geography : France is divided into 59 dioceses and 10 ecclesiastical provinces . <p>Napoleon was baptised in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771 . He was raised as a Catholic but never developed much faith . [220] As an adult , Napoleon was a deist , believing in an absent and distant God . However , he had a keen appreciation of the power of organized religion in social and political affairs , and he paid a great deal of attention to bending it to his purposes . He noted the influence of Catholicism's rituals and splendors . [220] </p><p>Napoleon had a civil marriage with Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais , without religious ceremony . Napoleon was crowned Emperor on 2 December 1804 at Notre-Dame de Paris in a ceremony presided over by Pope Pius VII . On the eve of the coronation ceremony , and at the insistence of Pope Pius VII , a private religious wedding ceremony of Napoleon and Jos\u00e9phine was celebrated . Cardinal Fesch performed the wedding . [221] This marriage was annulled by tribunals under Napoleon's control in January 1810 . On 1 April 1810 , Napoleon married the Austrian princess Marie Louise in a Catholic ceremony . Napoleon was excommunicated by the Catholic Church , but later reconciled with the Church before his death in 1821 . [222] While in exile in Saint Helena he is recorded to have said \"I know men ; and I tell you that Jesus Christ is not a man . \"[223][224][225] </p> <h3>Concordat</h3> Further information : Concordat of 1801 Leaders of the Catholic Church taking the civil oath required by the Concordat <p>Seeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics , the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII . It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status . The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved . The Concordat did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off . As a part of the Concordat , Napoleon presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles . [226][227] </p><p>While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy , the balance of church\u2013state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour . He selected the bishops and supervised church finances . Napoleon and the Pope both found the Concordat useful . Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon , especially Italy and Germany . [228] Now , Napoleon could win favour with the Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense . Napoleon said in April 1801 , \"Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests . They can both contain them and use them\" . French children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect Napoleon . [229] </p> <h3>Arrest of Pope Pius VII</h3> <p>In 1809 , under Napoleon's orders , Pope Pius VII was placed under arrest in Italy , and in 1812 the prisoner Pontiff was transferred to France , being held in the Palace of Fontainebleau . [230] Because the arrest was made in a clandestine manner , some sources[231][230] describe it as a kidnapping . The Pope was only released in 1814 when the Allies invaded France . In January 1813 , Napoleon personally forced the Pope to sign a humiliating \"Concordat of Fontainebleau\" . [232] The 1813 document was later repudiated by the Pontiff . [233] </p> <h3>Religious emancipation</h3> Further information : Napoleon and the Jews and Napoleon and Protestants <p>Napoleon emancipated Jews , as well as Protestants in Catholic countries and Catholics in Protestant countries , from laws which restricted them to ghettos , and he expanded their rights to property , worship , and careers . Despite the antisemitic reaction to Napoleon's policies from foreign governments and within France , he believed emancipation would benefit France by attracting Jews to the country given the restrictions they faced elsewhere . [234] </p><p>In 1806 an assembly of Jewish notables was gathered by Napoleon to discuss 12 questions broadly dealing with the relations between Jews and Christians , as well as other issues dealing with the Jewish ability to integrate into French society . Later , after the questions were answered in a satisfactory way according to the Emperor , a \"great Sanhedrin\" was brought together to transform the answers into decisions that would form the basis of the future status of the Jews in France and the rest of the empire Napoleon was building . [235] </p><p>He stated , \"I will never accept any proposals that will obligate the Jewish people to leave France , because to me the Jews are the same as any other citizen in our country . It takes weakness to chase them out of the country , but it takes strength to assimilate them\" . [236] He was seen as so favourable to the Jews that the Russian Orthodox Church formally condemned him as \"Antichrist and the Enemy of God\" . [237] </p><p>One year after the final meeting of the Sanhedrin , on 17 March 1808 , Napoleon placed the Jews on probation . Several new laws restricting the citizenship the Jews had been offered 17 years previously were instituted at that time . However , despite pressure from leaders of a number of Christian communities to refrain from granting Jews emancipation , within one year of the issue of the new restrictions , they were once again lifted in response to the appeal of Jews from all over France . [235] </p> <h2>Personality</h2> Napoleon visiting the Palais Royal for the opening of the 8th session of the Tribunat in 1807 , by Merry-Joseph Blondel <p>Historians emphasize the strength of the ambition that took Napoleon from an obscure village to command of most of Europe . [238] In-depth academic studies about his early life conclude that up until age 2 , he had a \"gentle disposition\" . [24] His older brother , Joseph , frequently received their mother's attention which made Napoleon more assertive and approval-driven . During his early schooling years he would be harshly bullied by classmates for his Corsican identity and control of the French language . To withstand the stress he became domineering , eventually developing an inferiority complex . [24] </p><p>George F . E . Rud\u00e9 stresses his \"rare combination of will , intellect and physical vigour\" . [239] In one-on-one situations he typically had a hypnotic effect on people , seemingly bending the strongest leaders to his will . [240] He understood military technology , but was not an innovator in that regard . [241] He was an innovator in using the financial , bureaucratic , and diplomatic resources of France . He could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates , keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point , and like a chess master , \"seeing\" the best plays moves ahead . [242] </p><p>Napoleon maintained strict , efficient work habits , prioritizing what needed to be done . He cheated at cards , but repaid the losses ; he had to win at everything he attempted . [243] He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work . Unlike many generals , Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation . Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck ; Napoleon responded , \"Give me lucky generals\" , arguing that \"luck\" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity , and seize it . [244] Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805\u201306 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity , leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility . [245] </p><p>In terms of influence on events , it was more than Napoleon's personality that took effect . He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars . [246] He inspired his men\u2014the Duke of Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40 , 000 soldiers , for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals . [247] He also unnerved the enemy . At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806 , King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63 , 000 to 27 , 000 ; however , when he was told , mistakenly , that Napoleon was in command , he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout . [248] The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win . [249] </p> <h2>Image</h2> Further information : Cultural depictions of Napoleon Napoleon is often represented in his green colonel uniform of the Chasseur \u00e0 Cheval of the Imperial Guard , the regiment that often served as his personal escort , with a large bicorne and a hand-in-waistcoat gesture . <p>Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolizes military genius and political power . Martin van Creveld described him as \"the most competent human being who ever lived\" . [250] Since his death , many towns , streets , ships , and even cartoon characters have been named after him . He has been portrayed in hundreds of films and discussed in hundreds of thousands of books and articles . [251] </p><p>When met in person , many of his contemporaries were surprised by his apparently unremarkable physical appearance in contrast to his significant deeds and reputation , especially in his youth , when he was consistently described as small and thin . Joseph Farington , who observed Napoleon personally in 1802 , commented that \"Samuel Rogers stood a little way from me and\u00a0 . . . seemed to be disappointed in the look of [Napoleon's] countenance [face] and said it was that of a little Italian . \" Farington said Napoleon's eyes were \"lighter , and more of a grey , than I should have expected from his complexion\" , that \"His person is below middle size\" , and that \"his general aspect was milder than I had before thought it . \"[252] </p><p>A personal friend of Napoleon's said that when he first met him in Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau as a young man , Napoleon was only notable \"for the dark color of his complexion , for his piercing and scrutinising glance , and for the style of his conversation\" ; he also said that Napoleon was personally a serious and somber man : \"his conversation bore the appearance of ill-humor , and he was certainly not very amiable . \"[253] Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger , who accompanied Napoleon from Camp Fornio in 1797 and on the Swiss campaign of 1798 , noted that \"Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking ; his face , too , was very thin , with a dark complexion\u00a0 . . . his black , unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders\" , but that , despite his slight and unkempt appearance , \"His looks and expression were earnest and powerful . \"[254] </p><p>Denis Davydov met him personally and considered him remarkably average in appearance : \"His face was slightly swarthy , with regular features . His nose was not very large , but straight , with a slight , hardly noticeable bend . The hair on his head was dark reddish-blond ; his eyebrows and eyelashes were much darker than the colour of his hair , and his blue eyes , set off by the almost black lashes , gave him a most pleasing expression\u00a0 . . . The man I saw was of short stature , just over five feet tall , rather heavy although he was only 37 years old . \"[255] </p><p>During the Napoleonic Wars he was taken seriously by the British press as a dangerous tyrant , poised to invade . Napoleon was mocked in British newspapers as a short tempered small man and he was nicknamed \"Little Boney in a strong fit\" . [256] A nursery rhyme warned children that Bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people ; the \"bogeyman\" . [257] At 1 . 57 metres ( 5\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in ) , he was the height of an average French male but short for an aristocrat or officer ( part of why he was assigned to the artillery , since at the time the infantry and cavalry required more commanding figures ) . [258] It is possible he was taller at 1 . 70\u00a0m ( 5\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in ) due to the difference in the French measurement of inches . [259] </p><p>Some historians believe that the reason for the mistake about his size at death came from use of an obsolete old French yardstick ( a French foot equals 33\u00a0cm , while an English foot equals 30 . 47\u00a0cm ) . [258] Napoleon was a champion of the metric system and had no use for the old yardsticks . It is more likely that he was 1 . 57\u00a0m ( 5\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in ) , the height he was measured at on St . Helena ( a British island ) , since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime . [258] Napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and was affectionately nicknamed le petit caporal ( the little corporal ) , reflecting his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height . </p><p>When he became First Consul and later Emperor , Napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the green colonel uniform ( non-Hussar ) of a colonel of the Chasseur \u00e0 Cheval of the Imperial Guard , the regiment that served as his personal escort many times , with a large bicorne . He also habitually wore ( usually on Sundays ) the blue uniform of a colonel of the Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers ( blue with white facings and red cuffs ) . He also wore his L\u00e9gion d'honneur star , medal and ribbon , and the Order of the Iron Crown decorations , white French-style culottes and white stockings . This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his marshals and those around him . </p><p>In his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow , something contemporaries took note of . Novelist Paul de Kock , who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the Tuileries , called Napoleon \"yellow , obese , and bloated\" . [260] A British captain who met him in 1815 stated \"I felt very much disappointed , as I believe everyone else did , in his appearance\u00a0 . . . He is fat , rather what we call pot-bellied , and although his leg is well shaped , it is rather clumsy\u00a0 . . . He is very sallow , with light grey eyes , and rather thin , greasy-looking brown hair , and altogether a very nasty , priestlike-looking fellow . \"[261] </p><p>The stock character of Napoleon is a comically short \"petty tyrant\" and this has become a clich\u00e9 in popular culture . He is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat with a hand-in-waistcoat gesture\u2014a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David . [262] In 1908 Alfred Adler , a psychologist , cited Napoleon to describe an inferiority complex in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height ; this inspired the term Napoleon complex . [263] </p> <h2>Reforms</h2> First remittance of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur , 15 July 1804 , at Saint-Louis des Invalides , by Jean-Baptiste Debret ( 1812 ) <p>Napoleon instituted various reforms , such as higher education , a tax code , road and sewer systems , and established the Banque de France , the first central bank in French history . He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church , which sought to reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime . It was presented alongside the Organic Articles , which regulated public worship in France . He dissolved the Holy Roman Empire prior to German Unification later in the 19th century . The sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States doubled the size of the United States . [264] </p><p>In May 1802 , he instituted the Legion of Honour , a substitute for the old royalist decorations and orders of chivalry , to encourage civilian and military achievements ; the order is still the highest decoration in France . [265] </p> <h3>Napoleonic Code</h3> Main article : Napoleonic Code First page of the 1804 original edition of the Code Civil <p>Napoleon's set of civil laws , the Code Civil\u2014now often known as the Napoleonic Code\u2014was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s , the Second Consul . Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts . The development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law . Other codes ( \"Les cinq codes\" ) were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law ; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published , which enacted rules of due process . [266] </p><p>The Napoleonic code was adopted throughout much of Continental Europe , though only in the lands he conquered , and remained in force after Napoleon's defeat . Napoleon said : \"My true glory is not to have won forty battles\u00a0 . . . Waterloo will erase the memory of so many victories . \u00a0 . . . But\u00a0 . . . what will live forever , is my Civil Code\" . [267] The Code influences a quarter of the world's jurisdictions such as that of in Continental Europe , the Americas and Africa . [268] </p><p>Dieter Langewiesche described the code as a \"revolutionary project\" which spurred the development of bourgeois society in Germany by the extension of the right to own property and an acceleration towards the end of feudalism . Napoleon reorganized what had been the Holy Roman Empire , made up of more than a thousand entities , [quantify] into a more streamlined forty-state Confederation of the Rhine ; this helped promote the German Confederation and the unification of Germany in 1871 . [269] </p><p>The movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule . [270] These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the nation state . [271] </p><p>Napoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe , especially in Italy and Germany , as summarized by British historian Andrew Roberts : </p> <link/><p>The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy , equality before the law , property rights , religious toleration , modern secular education , sound finances , and so on\u2014were championed , consolidated , codified and geographically extended by Napoleon . To them he added a rational and efficient local administration , an end to rural banditry , the encouragement of science and the arts , the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire . [272]</p> <p>Napoleon directly overthrew remnants of feudalism in much of western Continental Europe . He liberalized property laws , ended seigneurial dues , abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship , legalized divorce , closed the Jewish ghettos and made Jews equal to everyone else . The Inquisition ended as did the Holy Roman Empire . The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for all men . [273] </p> <h3>Warfare</h3> Further information : Napoleonic weaponry and warfare and Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte Statue in Cherbourg-Octeville unveiled by Napoleon III in 1858 . Napoleon I strengthened the town's defences to prevent British naval incursions . <p>In the field of military organization , Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte , Comte de Guibert , and from the reforms of preceding French governments , and then developed much of what was already in place . He continued the policy , which emerged from the Revolution , of promotion based primarily on merit . [274] </p><p>Corps replaced divisions as the largest army units , mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries , the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine . These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare . [274] Though he consolidated the practice of modern conscription introduced by the Directory , one of the restored monarchy's first acts was to end it . [275] </p><p>His opponents learned from Napoleon's innovations . The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force , the growth in artillery numbers , and changes in artillery practices . As a result of these factors , Napoleon , rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences , now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry . McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and , later , France's inferiority in cavalry numbers . [276] Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras , but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change . [277] </p><p>Napoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare . Antoine-Henri Jomini explained Napoleon's methods in a widely used textbook that influenced all European and American armies . [278] Napoleon was regarded by the influential military theorist Carl von Clausewitz as a genius in the operational art of war , and historians rank him as a great military commander . [279] Wellington , when asked who was the greatest general of the day , answered : \"In this age , in past ages , in any age , Napoleon\" . [280] </p><p>Under Napoleon , a new emphasis towards the destruction , not just outmanoeuvring , of enemy armies emerged . Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive . The political effect of war increased ; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves . Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts , intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war . [281] </p> <h3>Metric system</h3> Main articles : History of the metric system , Mesures usuelles , and Units of measurement in France Depicted as First Consul on the 1803 20 gold Napol\u00e9on gold coin <p>The official introduction of the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society . Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence . Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles ( traditional units of measurement ) for retail trade , [282] a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but were based on the kilogram and the metre ; for example , the livre metrique ( metric pound ) was 500\u00a0g , [283] in contrast to the value of the livre du roi ( the king's pound ) , 489 . 5\u00a0g . [284] Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive introduction of the metric system across parts of Europe in the middle of the 19th century . [285] </p> <h3>Education</h3> <p>Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe . [286] Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien R\u00e9gime , The Enlightenment , and the Revolution , with the aim of establishing a stable , well-educated and prosperous society . He made French the only official language . He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders , but he offered public support to secondary education . Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools ( lyc\u00e9es ) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France . [287] </p><p>All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages . Unlike the system during the Ancien R\u00e9gime , religious topics did not dominate the curriculum , although they were present with the teachers from the clergy . Napoleon hoped to use religion to produce social stability . [287] He gave special attention to the advanced centers , such as the \u00c9cole Polytechnique , that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science . [288] Napoleon made some of the first efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education . [when?] The system featured scholarships and strict discipline , with the result being a French educational system that outperformed its European counterparts , many of which borrowed from the French system . [289] </p> <h2>Memory and evaluation</h2> <h3>Criticism</h3> The Third of May 1808 by Francisco Goya , showing Spanish resisters being executed by French troops <p>In the political realm , historians debate whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\" . [290] Many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions . The Continental powers as late as 1808 were willing to give him nearly all of his gains and titles , but some scholars maintain he was overly aggressive and pushed for too much , until his empire collapsed . [291][292] </p><p>Napoleon ended lawlessness and disorder in post-Revolutionary France . [293] He was considered a tyrant and usurper by his opponents . [294] His critics[who?] charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands , turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout Europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike . His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's overseas colonies are controversial and affect his reputation . [295] </p><p>Napoleon institutionalized plunder of conquered territories : French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon's forces from across Europe . Artefacts were brought to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre for a grand central museum ; his example would later serve as inspiration for more notorious imitators . [296] He was compared to Adolf Hitler by the historian Pieter Geyl in 1947 , [297] and Claude Ribbe in 2005 . [298] David G . Chandler , a historian of Napoleonic warfare , wrote in 1973 that , \"Nothing could be more degrading to the former [Napoleon] and more flattering to the latter [Hitler] . The comparison is odious . On the whole Napoleon was inspired by a noble dream , wholly dissimilar from Hitler's\u00a0 . . . Napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius\u2014in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day . Adolf Hitler left nothing but destruction . \"[299] </p><p>Critics argue Napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule : historian Victor Davis Hanson writes , \"After all , the military record is unquestioned\u201417 years of wars , perhaps six million Europeans dead , France bankrupt , her overseas colonies lost . \"[300] McLynn states that , \"He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars . \"[294] Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name , when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution . [301] </p><p>British military historian Correlli Barnett calls him \"a social misfit\" who exploited France for his personal megalomaniac goals . He says Napoleon's reputation is exaggerated . [302] French scholar Jean Tulard provided an influential account of his image as a saviour . [303] Louis Bergeron has praised the numerous changes he made to French society , especially regarding the law as well as education . [304] His greatest failure was the Russian invasion . Many historians have blamed Napoleon's poor planning , but Russian scholars instead emphasize the Russian response , noting the notorious winter weather was just as hard on the defenders . [305] </p><p>The large and growing historiography in French , English , Russian , Spanish and other languages has been summarized and evaluated by numerous scholars . [306][307][308] </p> <h3>Propaganda and memory</h3> Main article : Napoleonic propaganda <p>Napoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power , legitimated his r\u00e9gime , and established his image for posterity . Strict censorship , controlling aspects of the press , books , theatre , and art , was part of his propaganda scheme , aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to France . The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign , focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier , and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader . Specifically targeting his civilian audience , Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community , taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals . [309] </p><p>In England , Russia and across Europe\u2014though not in France\u2014Napoleon was a popular topic of caricature . [310][311][312] </p><p>Hazareesingh ( 2004 ) explores how Napoleon's image and memory are best understood . They played a key role in collective political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815\u20131830 . People from different walks of life and areas of France , particularly Napoleonic veterans , drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution . [313] </p><p>Widespread rumours of Napoleon's return from St . Helena and Napoleon as an inspiration for patriotism , individual and collective liberties , and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials , displaying the tricolor and rosettes . There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of Napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations\u2014they demonstrated the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of Napoleon to constantly destabilize the Bourbon regime . [313] </p><p>Datta ( 2005 ) shows that , following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s , the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture . Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period\u2014Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-G\u00eane ( 1893 ) , Maurice Barr\u00e8s's Les D\u00e9racin\u00e9s ( 1897 ) , Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon ( 1900 ) , and Andr\u00e9 de Lorde and Gyp's Napol\u00e9onette ( 1913 ) \u2014Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle \u00c9poque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends . [314] </p><p>Reduced to a minor character , the new fictional Napoleon became not a world historical figure but an intimate one , fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment . In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity , proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend as a vehicle for exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture . [314] </p><p>International Napoleonic Congresses take place regularly , with participation by members of the French and American military , French politicians and scholars from different countries . [315] In January 2012 , the mayor of Montereau-Fault-Yonne , near Paris\u2014the site of a late victory of Napoleon\u2014proposed development of Napoleon's Bivouac , a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros . [316] </p> <ul> <li> <p>Napoleon Crossing the Alps , romantic version by Jacques-Louis David in 1805 </p> </li> <li> <p>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps , realist version by Paul Delaroche in 1848 </p> </li> </ul> <h3>Long-term influence outside France</h3> Main article : Influence of the French Revolution Bas-relief of Napoleon I in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives <p>Napoleon was responsible for spreading the values of the French Revolution to other countries , especially in legal reform and the abolition of serfdom . [317] </p><p>After the fall of Napoleon , not only was the Napoleonic Code retained by conquered countries including the Netherlands , Belgium , parts of Italy and Germany , but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic , the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec . [318] The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favourable , for his support for independence and opposition to Russia , his legal code , the abolition of serfdom , and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies . [319] </p><p>Napoleon could be considered one of the founders of modern Germany . After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire , he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50 , prior to German Unification . A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism . Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson . That territory almost doubled the size of the United States , adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union . [264] </p> <h2>Marriages and children</h2> <p>Napoleon married Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais in 1796 , when he was 26 ; she was a 32-year-old widow whose first husband had been executed during the Revolution . Five days after Jos\u00e9phine's first husband's death , the Reign of Terror initiator Maximilien de Robespierre was executed , and , with the help of high-placed friends , Jos\u00e9phine was freed . [320] Until she met Bonaparte , she had been known as \"Rose\" , a name which he disliked . He called her \"Jos\u00e9phine\" instead , and she went by this name henceforth . Bonaparte often sent her love letters while on his campaigns . [321] He formally adopted her son Eug\u00e8ne and second cousin ( via marriage ) St\u00e9phanie and arranged dynastic marriages for them . Jos\u00e9phine had her daughter Hortense marry Napoleon's brother Louis . [322] </p><p>Jos\u00e9phine had lovers , such as Lieutenant Hippolyte Charles , during Napoleon's Italian campaign . [323] Napoleon learnt of that affair and a letter he wrote about it was intercepted by the British and published widely , to embarrass Napoleon . Napoleon had his own affairs too : during the Egyptian campaign he took Pauline Bellisle Four\u00e8s , the wife of a junior officer , as his mistress . She became known as \"Cleopatra\" . [h][325] </p><p>While Napoleon's mistresses had children by him , Jos\u00e9phine did not produce an heir , possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the Reign of Terror or an abortion she may have had in her twenties . [326] Napoleon chose divorce so he could remarry in search of an heir . Despite his divorce from Josephine , Napoleon showed his dedication to her for the rest of his life . When he heard the news of her death while on exile in Elba , he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days . [191] Her name would also be his final word on his deathbed in 1821 . </p><p>On 11 March 1810 by proxy , he married the 19-year-old Marie Louise , Archduchess of Austria , and a great niece of Marie Antoinette . Thus he had married into a German royal and imperial family . [327] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement , at least at first , stating : \"Just to see the man would be the worst form of torture\" . Her great-aunt had been executed in France , while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career . However , she seemed to warm up to him over time . After her wedding , she wrote to her father : \"He loves me very much . I respond to his love sincerely . There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist\" . [191] </p><p>Napoleon and Marie Louise remained married until his death , though she did not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again . The couple had one child , Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles ( 1811\u20131832 ) , known from birth as the King of Rome . He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks . He was awarded the title of the Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21 , with no children . [327] </p><p>Napoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son : Charles L\u00e9on ( 1806\u20131881 ) by El\u00e9onore Denuelle de La Plaigne . [328] Alexandre Colonna-Walewski ( 1810\u20131868 ) , the son of his mistress Maria Walewska , although acknowledged by Walewska's husband , was also widely known to be his child , and the DNA of his direct male descendant has been used to help confirm Napoleon's Y-chromosome haplotype . [329] He may have had further unacknowledged illegitimate offspring as well , such as Eugen Megerle von M\u00fchlfeld by Emilie Victoria Kraus[330] and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Napoleone Bonaparte ( 1816\u20131907 ) by Albine de Montholon . </p> <ul> <li> <p>Napoleon's first wife , Jos\u00e9phine , Empress of the French , painted by Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard , 1801 </p> </li> <li> <p>Napoleon's second wife , Marie-Louise ( Empress Marie-Louise and the King of Rome , by Joseph Franque , 1812 ) </p> </li> </ul> <h2>Titles , styles , honours , and arms</h2> Main article : Titles and styles of Napoleon <h2>See also</h2> <ul><li>Arenenberg</li></ul> <h2>Notes</h2> <li>^ The first known record of him signing his name as Bonaparte was when he was 27 ( in 1796 ) . [9][7][10] In his youth , his name was also spelled as Nabulione , Nabulio , Napolionne , and Napulione . [11] </li> <li>^ Although the 1768 Treaty of Versailles formally ceded Corsica's rights , it remained un-incorporated during 1769[13] until it became a province of France in 1770 . [14] Corsica would be legally integrated as a d\u00e9partement in 1789 . [15][16] </li> <li>^ Aside from his name , there does not appear to be a connection between him and Napoleon's theorem . [29] </li> <li>^ He was mainly referred to as Bonaparte until he became First Consul for life . [33] </li> <li>^ This is depicted in Bonaparte Crossing the Alps by Hippolyte Delaroche and in Jacques-Louis David's imperial Napoleon Crossing the Alps . He is less realistically portrayed on a charger in the latter work . [87] </li> <li>^ It was customary to cast a death mask of a leader . At least four genuine death masks of Napoleon are known to exist : one in The Cabildo in New Orleans , one in a Liverpool museum , another in Havana and one in the library of the University of North Carolina . [211] </li> <li>^ The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly , and arsenic was a fashionable cure-all . [218] </li> <li>^ One night , during an illicit liaison with the actress Marguerite George , Napoleon had a major fit . This and other more minor attacks have led historians to debate whether he had epilepsy and , if so , to what extent . [324] </li> <h2>Citations</h2> <li>^ \"Napoleon\" , \"Bonaparte\" .
